<p>The following pages are presented to the public by one of the survivors of
this worst of prisons, believing it will be read with deep interest by every
American, and by every relative and friend of those who happened to be one
of the unfortunate inmates of the Dartmoor Prison.</p>

<p>If any part of the work should be found languid and tedious, it must be
wholly attributed to the suffering situation of the author; the vigor and
vivacity of whose mind was greatly affected by those of the body. If
misery is less interesting collectively in groups than when viewed individually,
let the reader single out one, and view him, separately, through the
iron grating, and see him, pale and feeble, etching upon a stick, with a
rusty nail, another notch, which adds to his calender another of those dismal
days and nights he had spent in confinement; he may view him till he sees
the iron enter his soul before he turns from him, and then say—it was my
son, my brother, or my friend!—he will then have a picture interesting
enough to his feelings.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE PRISONERS’ MEMOIRS,</p>
</div>

<p class="ph4">OR</p>

<p class="ph2">DARTMOOR PRISON.</p>


<p>The war between the United States of America and Great
Britain, which has been so costly in blood and treasure, and
agonized the hearts of so many thousands of our fellow-beings,
was formally declared, by a proclamation issued by the President
of the United States, in conformity with a solemn act of
the supreme legislature of the nation, on the eighteenth day
of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred
and twelve. The nations were, by this act, at open hostilities,
and began to capture each other’s vessels upon the high seas,
wherever found. I myself happened to be so unfortunate as
to be among the first captives brought into England. On our
first arrival there, we were all collected from different ports,
and confined in different prisons. Some were sent to Chatham,
some to Hamoze, and others to Portsmouth; where a
strict examination took place as to their nativity and citizenship.
After the examination, the officers who were entitled
to their parole, (such as commanders and first lieutenants of
privateers mounting fourteen guns, commanders and first mates
of merchantmen, non-combatants, &amp;c.) received it, and were
sent to the little village of Ashburton, in Devonshire, or Reading,
in Berkshire; the former is situated about twenty-six
miles inland from Plymouth, and the principal place of confinement
for paroled officers. The town of Ashburton is
pleasantly situated in a healthy and fertile part of the country,
where every article of provision is more easily obtained and
at a much cheaper rate than in many other parts of the kingdom.
Here all the officers on parole had their names registered,
and particular personal description taken of them.
They had allowed them by the British government one shilling
and six pence, which is equal to thirty-three and a quarter
cents, money of the United States, per day each man. With<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
this small allowance, great numbers of paroled officers were
compelled entirely to subsist, for having no other dependence
and no friends in this country, they were obliged to purchase
clothing, board, and lodging, and all other necessaries of life,
and to make use of every economy to prevent themselves from
suffering, notwithstanding the cheapness of provisions, and the
facility of obtaining them. They were permitted, during the
day, to walk one mile on the turnpike road towards London or
Plymouth, and at a certain early hour every evening they had
to retire to their respective lodgings, and there to remain till
next morning; those were their general restrictions for all the
days in the week, except two, on which every officer must answer
at a particular place appointed by their keepers, in the
presence of their agent or inspector. In this manner some
hundreds of officers were compelled to drag out a tedious existence
in a state of painful solicitude for their country, their
homes and families, during the greater part of the late war.</p>

<p>But the condition of the officers on parole was enviable indeed,
when compared with that of the officers and others not
entitled to that privilege. Every such person taken under the
flag of the United States, were sent to some one of the places
before mentioned, and confined on board prison ships. The
greatest number were sent to the Hector and La Brave, two
line of battle ships which were unfit for his majesty’s service
at sea, and were now used for the confinement of prisoners of
war. These were placed under the command of a lieutenant,
master’s mate, midshipman, and about twenty invalid seamen;
there is also a guard under the command of a lieutenant, ensign,
and corporal, consisting of thirty-five soldiers to each of
these ships.</p>

<p>The Hector and La Brave lie about two miles from Plymouth,
well moored by chain moorings. Captain Edward
Pelew, of the royal navy, the agent for prisoners of war, resides
at this place. On the reception of all prisoners into
their respective prison ships, they were obliged to undergo a
strict examination concerning their birth, place of residence,
and age; a complete and minute description of their person
in all respects was taken down in writing. After the examination,
there was delivered to each man a very coarse and
worthless hammock, with a thin coarse bed-sack, with at most
not more than three or four pounds of flops or chopped rags,
one thin coarse and sleazy blanket; this furniture of the <i>bedchamber</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
was to last for a year and a half before we could
draw others. After the distribution of the bedding, we were
informed of the rules and restrictions which we must strictly
observe. Every ship has a physician attached to it, who is
ever to be on board, and when any prisoner is sick, he is to
repair immediately to a certain part of the ship for medical
aid; but seldom has he any attention paid him till the moment
of dissolution, the doctors paying but little attention to the suffering
prisoners, although a prisoner is seldom or never suffered
to expire on board; for at the moment death seems inevitably
approaching, the prisoner is removed to a ship lying near
by, called the hospital ship, where if he happen to survive the
removal, he receives much better treatment and attendance;
but when once removed to that ship, they may bid adieu to
their fellow-prisoners, and most of them to sublunary things;
for not more than one out of ten ever recovers.</p>

<p>We were then informed, that the Transport Board had most
<i>graciously</i> and <i>humanely</i>, for the health and happiness of the
prisoners, imposed on them the following duty; to keep clean
the ship’s decks and hold; to hoist in water, provisions, coal,
and every other article expended or used in the ship; and also
to permit the prisoners to cook their own victuals, which consisted
of the following rations allowed by the English government:
To each man one pound and a half of very poor
coarse bread, half a pound of beef, including the bone, one-third
of an ounce of salt, and the same quantity of barley,
with one or two turnips, per man. These were the rations for
five days in the week; the other two were fish days, the rations
for which were one pound of salt fish, the same weight
of potatoes, and the usual allowance of bread.</p>

<p>The confinement, and this scanty and meager diet for men
who were brought up in a land of liberty, and ever used to
feast on the luscious fruits of plenty, soon brought on a pale
and sickly countenance, a feeble and dejected spirit, and a
lean, half animate body. This bad state of living, I solemnly
believe, has been the serious cause of inducing many valuable
citizens of the United States to enter the king’s service, to the
great injury of their country.</p>

<p>The prisoners are counted every night as they are ordered
below by the guard; and every morning, about sunrise, each
prisoner is obliged to “take up his bed and walk;” for he is
ordered to shoulder his hammock and go on deck, and be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
counted with it on his shoulder. He then leaves his hammock
on deck all day, and has permission to go below or remain on
deck, as best suits his convenience.</p>

<p>No prisoner is permitted to hold any correspondence, except
by unsealed letters passing through the hands of the Board of
Transport. No boat is permitted to come alongside the ship,
unless by permission of the commanding officer, and then
must be strictly examined by the sentry, to prevent any liquor,
newspapers, or candles, from coming among the prisoners;
these being prohibited by the <i>gracious</i> and <i>humane</i> Board of
Transport.</p>

<p>For consolation in our present miserable condition, we were
informed that the said <i>honorable</i> Board had indulgently permitted
the American prisoners to establish and carry on any
branch of manufacture, except such as netting, woollen fabrics,
making straw hats and bonnets, &amp;c. &amp;c.; or rather, they prohibited
every branch of manufactory which they were capable
of pursuing. At this time they could have carried on the
making of straw into flats for bonnets with very considerable
advantage, as almost every sailor was more or less capable of
working at this art, and, by strict attention to the business,
could have earned six or eight pence sterling per day: but
this was not permitted, and we considered this prohibition a
contrivance of the agents of government to induce the prisoners
to enter his majesty’s service. Their situation was now
so abject and wretched, that they were willing to embrace any
opportunity where there was the least prospect of bettering
their condition, however repugnant to their feelings or sentiments;
and though their country’s interest was ever nearest
to their hearts, yet, through the faint hope of ameliorating
their condition, and some day or other of returning to their
native land, their wives and families, some of less fortitude
were induced to join in arms against their country. It could
not be a crime; for self-preservation is the first law of nature.</p>

<p>From the first of our imprisonment, which was shortly after
the commencement of the war, prisoners were constantly arriving,
and immediately disposed of in one or other of these
depots:—among them were great numbers of American seamen
who had been delivered up from the different ships of war
in the English service, on board of which they had remained
from one to ten years, and after receiving many dozen lashes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
at the gangway of the ships, were sent to prison with the appellation
of “dammed rebellious villains, unfit for his majesty’s
service!”</p>

<p>During the fall of the year one thousand eight hundred and
twelve, until April in one thousand eight hundred and thirteen,
the English had collected at the following depots the number
hereinafter mentioned, who were mostly prisoners delivered up
from ships of war, and citizens of the United States detained
in them for some time before. At Chatham were collected
about nine hundred; at Portsmouth, about one hundred; and
at Plymouth, about seven hundred. These unfortunate men
had often made application to Mr. Beasley, the agent for
American prisoners of war, who resided in England, but were
never able to obtain an answer from him. At this time, great
numbers of the oldest prisoners were completely destitute of
clothing, and the most active and cleanly unable to avoid being
covered with vermin.</p>

<p>On the second of April, one thousand eight hundred and
thirteen, the Transport Board, apprehending the escape of the
prisoners, in consequence of their repeated threats to that purpose,
issued an order to Captain Pelew, then agent for the prisoners
at Plymouth, to make preparation for removing all the
prisoners then confined on board the Hector prison-ship, at
Plymouth, to the depot at Dartmoor, in the county of Devon,
situated seventeen miles from Plymouth, in the back country.</p>

<p>These orders were accordingly made known to the prisoners;
and on the morning of the third of April, they were ordered
on deck, with their hammocks, baggage, &amp;c., in readiness
to march to a prison, the very name of which made the mind
of every prisoner “shrink back with dread, and startle at the
thought;” for fame had made them well acquainted with the
horrors of that infernal abode, which was by far the most
dreadful prison in all England, and in which it was next to
impossible for human beings long to survive.</p>

<p>Two hundred and fifty dejected and unhappy sufferers, already
too wretched, were called, each of whom received a
pair of shoes, and his allowance of bread and salt fish. Orders
were then immediately given, for every man to deliver
up his bed and hammock, and to repair forthwith into the different
launches belonging to the ships of war, which were
alongside the ship, ready to receive them. The prisoners
entered, surrounded by the guards and seamen belonging to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
the Hector and La Brave. We were landed at New Passage,
near Plymouth, and were placed under the guard of a company
of soldiers, equal in number to the prisoners! Orders
were then given to march at half-past ten in the morning, with
a positive injunction that no prisoner should step out of, or
leave the ranks, on pain of instant death. Thus we marched,
surrounded by a strong guard, through a heavy rain, and over
a bad road, with only our usual and scanty allowance of bread
and fish. We were allowed to stop only once during the march
of seventeen miles.</p>

<p>We arrived at Dartmoor late in the after part of the day,
and found the ground covered with snow. Nothing could form
a more dreary prospect than that which now presented itself
to our hopeless view. Death itself, with the hopes of an hereafter,
seemed less terrible than this gloomy prison.</p>

<p>The prison at Dartmoor is situated on the east side of one of
the highest and most barren mountains in England, and is surrounded
on all sides, as far as the eye can see, by the gloomy
features of a black moor, uncultivated and uninhabited, except
by one or two miserable cottages, just discernible in an eastern
view, the tenants of which live by cutting turf on the moor,
and selling it at the prison. The place is deprived of every
thing that is pleasant or agreeable, and is productive of nothing
but human woe and misery. Even riches, pleasant
friends and liberty could not make it agreeable. It is situated
seventeen miles distant from Plymouth, fourteen from the town
of Moorton, and seven from the little village of Tavastock.</p>

<p>On entering this depot “of living death,” we first passed
through the gates, and found ourselves surrounded by two
huge circular walls, the outer one of which is a mile in circumference
and sixteen feet high; the inner wall is distant
from the outer thirty feet, around which is a chain of bells suspended
by a wire, so that the least touch sets every bell in motion,
and alarms the garrison. On the top of the inner wall is
placed a guard at the distance of every twenty feet, which
frustrates every attempt at escape, and instantly quells every
disorderly motion of the prisoners. Between the two walls
and over the intermediate space, are also stationed guards.
The soldiers’ guard house, the turnkey’s office, and many other
small buildings, are also within these two circular walls. Likewise
several large commodious dwelling-houses, which are
occupied by the captain of the prison, doctor, clerks, turnkeys,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
&amp;c., &amp;c. Inside of the walls are erected large barracks, capacious
enough to contain one thousand soldiers, and also a
hospital for the reception of the sick. No pains have been
spared to render the hospital convenient and comfortable for
the sick prisoner. And certainly much credit is due to the
director of this humane institution, whoever he may have been,
for the attention paid to this most important appendage of an
extensive prison. These last mentioned buildings, and several
small store-houses, are enclosed by a third wall. These three
ranks of walls form in this direction a barrier which is insurmountable.</p>

<p>Thus much for the court-yard of this seminary of misery;
we shall next proceed to give a description of the gloomy mansion
itself. On entering, we found seven prisons enclosed in
the following manner, and situated quite within all the walls
before mentioned. Prison No. 1, 2 and 3, are built of hard,
rough, unhewn stone, three stories high, one hundred and
eighty feet long and forty broad; each of these prisons, on an
average, are to contain fifteen hundred prisoners. There is
also attached to the yard of these prisons a house of correction,
called a cachot; this is built of large stone, arched above and
floored with the same. Into this cold, dark, and damp cell,
the unhappy prisoner is cast if he offend against the rules of
the prison, either willingly or inadvertently, and often on the
most frivolous pretence. There he must remain for many
days, and often weeks, on two-thirds the usual allowance of
food, without a hammock or bed, and nothing but a stone pavement
for his chair and bed. These three prisons are situated
on the north side of the enclosure, as is also the cachot, and
separated from the other prisons by a wall. Next to these is
another, No. 4, which is equally as large as any of the others;
this is separated from all the others by a wall on each side,
and stands in the centre of the circular walls.</p>

<p>Adjoining to this, are situated, in rotation, prisons No. 5, 6,
and 7, along the south side of the circular wall. To each
prison is attached a small yard, with a constant run of water
passing through it.</p>

<p>After viewing this huge pile of building, and obtaining what
little information we were able at this time, we were informed
that these seven prisons contained a <i>small family</i> of French
people, consisting of about eight thousand, who were also prisoners
of war. Among these fluttering, ghastly skeletons, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
were directed to take up our abode, and distribute ourselves as
well as we could.</p>

<p>We received our usual hammock and bed, and in conformity
with our orders, repaired separately to one or other of six of
these prisons; the seventh being allotted to those criminals
who had committed misdemeanors, such as murder, larceny
on their fellow-prisoners, and other heinous offences, which too
frequently occurred.</p>

<p>We entered the prisons; but here the heart of every American
was appalled. Amazement struck the unhappy victim;
for as he cast his hopeless eyes around the prison, he saw the
water constantly dropping from the cold stone walls on every
side, which kept the floor (made of stone) constantly wet, and
cold as ice.</p>

<p>All the prison floors were either stone or cement, and each
story contained but one apartment, and resembled long vacant
horse-stables. There were in each story six tiers of joists for
the prisoners to fasten their hammocks to. The hammocks
have a stick at each end to spread them out, and are hung in
the manner of cots, four or five deep, or one above the other.
On each side of the prison is left a vacancy for a passage from
one end of the prison to the other. We were then informed that
the prisoners must be counted out and messed, six together,
every morning by the guards and turnkeys.</p>

<p>During the month of April there was scarce a day but more
or less rain fell. The weather here is almost constantly wet and
foggy, on account of the prison being situated on the top of a
mountain, whose elevation is two thousand feet above the level
of the sea. This height is equal to the plane on which the clouds
generally float in a storm, the atmosphere not being dense
enough to support heavy clouds much above that height; almost
every one that passes that way finds the top of the mountain
enveloped in a thick fog and heavy torrent of rain. In winter
the same cause makes as frequent snows as rain in summer.
It is also some degrees colder during the whole year than in
the adjacent country below. This too is occasioned by the
great elevation of the top of the mountain, which is above the
atmosphere heated by the reflected rays of the sun upon the
common surface of the earth, and being small of itself, reflects
but little heat. These two causes combined, produce constant
cold and wet weather.</p>

<p>Information was brought us that all prisoners in England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
were placed on a naval establishment, and under the direction
of a naval officer. Captain Isaac Cotgrave, of the royal navy,
was the agent for the prisoners of war at this depot. The
Transport Board directed that a market should be held every
day, in front of each prison yard. This market was supplied
with provisions by the inhabitants of the adjacent country;
twenty or thirty of whom came every day, and furnished it
with every kind of country produce. They were not allowed
to impose on the prisoners, by demanding an exhorbitant price
for their produce; the prices of every article were fixed by
the turnkeys before they entered the yard, according to the
prices in the nearest market-town. No person was permitted
to enter within the first gate, without being strictly examined
as to their business, and without giving a satisfactory account
of themselves; if they did this, they were then permitted
to enter and begin their trade.</p>

<p>At the market, the French prisoners carry on a great traffic.
They buy and sell, and are, apparently, as happy as if
they were not imprisoned. But the Americans are not so;—they
long for that land of liberty, so dear to them, and sigh for
their distant home.</p>

<p>As this depot seems to be the most interesting scene of misery,
we shall confine ourselves more particularly to the events
which occurred here; only touching, occasionally, upon the
most important events of the few prisoners at the other depots.</p>

<p>From the commencement of the war, and previous to April
1813, a great number of prisoners had been sent home, by exchange.
Numbers died, and some entered the service of Great
Britain. The names of those who died, and those who entered
the service, are mentioned in the catalogue hereunto annexed.
About the first of May, Captain Cotgrave gave orders to
have all the American prisoners collected from the different
prisons, and transferred to prison No. 4.</p>

<p>In this prison were about nine hundred of the most abject
and outcast wretches that were ever beheld. French prisoners,
too wicked and malicious to live with their other unfortunate
countrymen: they were literally and emphatically naked;
having neither clothing or shoes, and as poor and meager in
flesh as the human frame could bear. Their appearance was
really shocking to human feeling. The mind cannot figure to
itself any thing in the shape of men, which so much resembled
the fabled ghosts of Pluto, as these naked and starved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
French prisoners. Much of the misery and wretchedness of
these creatures was owing to their imprudence and bad conduct.</p>

<p>These men were now to be our associates, and we deprived
of the privileges allowed heretofore to prisoners of war. As
the gate of this yard is always kept shut, we could have no
advantage of the markets, or connexion with the other prisoners;
while the French prisoners, in the other prisons, were
allowed those benefits.</p>

<p>The American prisoners now began to experience a new
scene of distress;—the little clothing they had when they
were taken, was either worn out or disposed of at a very reduced
price, (not more than one tenth of the value,) to buy
the very necessary articles of soap and tobacco.</p>

<p>We remained in this situation during the month of May,
one thousand eight hundred and thirteen, close confined in
prison No. 4, with the liberty of that one yard. We often
demanded of Captain Cotgrave, the reason why such distinction
was made between the American and French prisoners;
but were never able to obtain any other reason, than that his
orders were issued from the Transport Board to do so. This
month we received letters from our fellow-prisoners at Chatham,
and those on board the prison ships at Plymouth; who
informed us of every particular of their situation at both places;
but they were comparatively well off, when compared
with our situation. The prisoners at Plymouth informed us,
that other prisoners arrived there daily, and that they expected
shortly to be removed, and to participate with us in the sufferings
and misery of Dartmoor.</p>

<p>On the twenty-ninth of May, the garrison which we found
here, was removed and supplied by new regiments of soldiers.
We learned, that no regiment is stationed here more than two
or three months at a time. These guards consist of about
twelve or fifteen hundred soldiers, who have been guilty of
some offence, disobedience of orders, or neglect of duty; and
are sent here as a punishment. By these soldiers we were
informed of the particulars of the actions of the Java and
Peacock.</p>

<p>At this time we made known, in as respectful a manner as
we could, all the particulars of our unhappy situation to Mr.
Reuben G. Beasley, agent for American prisoners of war.
We informed him that our allowance was too scanty, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
whole day’s allowance was scarcely enough for one meal, that
the greater part of the prisoners were in a state of nakedness;
and also, that great numbers had enlisted out of the prison,
into the king’s service;—that they had been compelled to do
it, in hopes to better their condition, and indeed to preserve
life. For, as they were wholly neglected by the agent of their
country, they saw no other means by which it was possible to
preserve existence—or ever to return to their country; as they
totally despaired of any exchange.</p>

<p>At the same time we informed him, that unless something
was done soon for our relief, we must all either (though reluctantly)
enter the service of the enemy, or fall a sacrifice to
famine and want.</p>

<p>We informed him also of the distinction which was made
between the French and American prisoners. The former
were allowed many privileges and advantages, which were
denied the latter; and that our treatment was contrary to
what we considered the custom and usage of civilized nations
in modern warfare. That we were hurried into the prison-house
before dark, locked up, to remain without any light or
fire till seven or eight o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>If a prisoner had to leave his hammock, <i>per necessitatem</i>, he
was obliged to grope from one end of the room to the other,
and often could not regain it during the whole night.</p>

<p>To all these petitions, complaints, and remonstrances, Mr.
Beasley returned no answer, nor took any notice of them
whatever; which, of course, made every prisoner despair of
any relief from him. These letters could not miscarry, or be
intercepted; for we had formed a course of correspondence
with several very respectable mercantile houses in London,
through which our letters were sure to reach Mr. Beasley by
private conveyance.</p>

<p>The month of June commenced with deep distress; for disease
was then added to nakedness and famine; and we were
still more severely dealt by. For Doctor Dyer, who was head
surgeon of the Hospital-department, would not permit an
American prisoner to be brought into the hospital, until his
complaint was completely confirmed, and often not until he
was so weak, and reduced so low, that it would take four men
to remove him on his hammock. For this conduct, he justified
himself by saying, that he had been acquainted with the impositions
of the Americans during the revolutionary war, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
that these impositions were not to be played off on him any
more.</p>

<p>A moment’s reflection must have convinced him, that it was
impossible for these men not to be sick, in their starved, naked
and wretched condition; sleeping in a prison, whose walls
were constantly wet and cold, occasioned by the constant rainy,
foggy, and damp weather on this mountain.</p>

<p>But he refused to admit the American prisoners into the
hospital, because, he said, such numbers would breed every
kind of pestilence and disease among the French prisoners.
We attributed these evils to the shameful and criminal neglect
of the agent of American prisoners, whose conduct deserves
the severest censure of every prisoner, and requires a strict
and impartial investigation by the authority of his country.</p>

<p>From the first to the fifteenth of May, we were every day
called out of the prison and counted, to see if any remained
in prison. The soldiers then entered the prison, and searched
every hammock; if they found any prisoner, he was hastened
out into the yard, though they were often found so weak and
feeble, that it required assistance to enable them to walk.</p>

<p>The guards discharged this duty with great reluctance;
their feelings often revolted, when compelled to do this unkind
office, and though accustomed to scenes of distress, were very
sensibly touched at the miserable situation of these their fellow
beings.</p>

<p>On the eighteenth of May, we received letters from the other
depots, and were informed that there were seven hundred prisoners
at Plymouth, on board the Hector, which was so much
crowded, that Captain Pelew, of the Royal Navy, and principal
agent of the Board, had received orders from the Board,
to remove the prisoners to other depots, either to that of Chatham,
Dartmoor, or Stapleton, which is near Bristol. This last
place was fixed on by the Board as a necessary precaution to
prevent any disturbance, which was apprehended might arise,
should too many American prisoners be confined in one place.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on the twenty-eighth, Captain Pelew ordered
two hundred and fifty to be landed from the Hector and marched
to Dartmoor. They arrived there on the same day, and
after going through the same manœuvre as the first draft, they
were committed to No. 4. These, together with the former
draft, made four hundred and seventy Americans, and seven
hundred naked outcast French, all intermixed in one prison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>Care was taken to keep the yard of this prison always locked,
to prevent us from going to market. By this means, all
we obtained from the market came through the hands of the
French prisoners in the other prisons, who obliged us to pay
twenty-five per cent. above the market price for all we had.
At this time, about thirty were missing out of the number,
some dead, and others had enlisted into the king’s service.</p>

<p>On the twenty-ninth, fifty more American prisoners were
transported from on board the Hector, in a ship of war, round
to Chatham. Two only at a time were permitted to come on
deck; the others were compelled to remain below, without
hammock, bed, or blanket. I leave the reader to judge whether
this measure arose from wanton cruelty in those immediately
concerned, or whether it was absolutely necessary to prevent
their escape, or rising and taking the ship, which had her
whole crew on board.</p>

<p>On the thirtieth, two hundred prisoners were ordered to go
ashore, who accordingly made themselves ready, and landed
at New Passage, under a guard of seamen and marines.
Here they were received by a guard of soldiers, consisting of
two hundred and fifty, who were to convey them on foot one
hundred and thirty-four miles to Stapleton, within a few miles
of Bristol.</p>

<p>Stapleton is a pleasant situation, and is a fine healthy country;
but the fatigue of the journey, the restrictions and inconvenience
to which the prisoners were subjected, presented
to them a melancholy prospect.</p>

<p>At the commencement of their journey, they were provided
with a shilling (twenty-two and a half cents) per day, for their
traveling expenses. This was all the allowance made them
to purchase food, drink, and lodging; and they were to perform
the whole journey in eight days. They were also particularly
enjoined not to leave the ranks on pain of death, and
the guard had orders to despatch any prisoner who should attempt
to escape. The particulars of their march, their arrival
at Stapleton, and treatment at that place, will be mentioned
hereafter.</p>

<p>On the first of July, two hundred more were ordered from
on board the Hector, to march and share with us the miseries
of Dartmoor. They were landed as usual, and marched under
a strong guard to that mountain of wretchedness, and after
passing through the usual forms at their arrival, were received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
into prison No. 4, and might justly have exclaimed, in the
language of an eminent poet, “Hail, horrors! hail, thou profoundest
hell! receive thy new possessor.” For every one
ordered to this prison, counted himself lost.</p>

<p>On the third of July, another draft of prisoners, consisting
of about two hundred and fifty, were taken from the Hector,
and sent to Stapleton, under the usual guard, allowance, and
restrictions.</p>

<p>The fourth of July, the birth-day of our nation, had now
arrived. The American prisoners, feeling that fire of patriotism,
and that just pride and honor, which fills the bosom of
every American, when that great day of jubilee arrives, roused
all their drooping spirits, and prepared to celebrate it in a
manner becoming their situation. We had by some means
obtained two American standards; and being upward of six
hundred in number, we divided into two columns, and displayed
our flags at each end of the prison. Of the propriety of
the proceedings, I leave the reader to judge. We were, however,
resolved to defend them till the last moment: but Captain
Cotgrave, either from a determination to depress our
spirits as much as possible, that we might the more readily be
induced to enter the service of the king, or that an enemy’s
flag should not be hoisted in their country, ordered the turnkeys
to enter the prison-yard, and take the colors from us.
We returned him an answer, that the day was the birth-day
of freedom, and the anniversary of our nation; and that he
would confer on us a particular favor, if he would permit us
to enjoy it with a decorum and propriety suited to our situation
as prisoners of war. We added this <i>arrogant</i> condition,
that if he should persist in attempting to take that flag which
we should ever respect, in whatever country we were, he
must abide by the consequences. Captain Cotgrave, being
irritated at this haughty and independent language, ordered
the guard into the prison-yard to take the standards from us.
An obstinate resistance was made. After some time spent in
fighting for the flags, the guard obtained one: the prisoners
bore off the other in triumph, and secured it. The remainder
of the day was spent in harmony and quietness. At evening,
when the guards came as usual to turn us into the prison, a
dispute arose upon the pitiful revenge sought for in depriving
the prisoners of their flag. This soon grew into an affray;
the guards fired upon the prisoners, and wounded two, which
ended the affray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>From the disturbance on the evening of the fourth, nothing
remarkable took place, the prisoners being generally tolerable
quiet and peaceable till the tenth, when a dispute arose between
the French and American prisoners in the yard of No.
4; the dispute was quite warm, and pervaded nearly all the
prisoners of both nations, each of whom espoused the cause of
his fellow-prisoner. Things were not pushed to extremities
this evening, the hour to turn in prevented their further progress;
but animosities had not subsided. At this time the
French prisoners occupied the two upper stories of prison No.
4; they consisted of about nine hundred outcasts from the
other prisons, as we had occasion to mention before. They
had during the night, with malice prepense, concerted a plan
to massacre the Americans. With this design, they had provided
themselves with knives, clubs, stones, staves, and every
kind of weapon they could obtain.</p>

<p>Thus armed, they had managed to be in the yard first in the
morning, and arrayed themselves to give battle as soon as a
sufficient number of Americans should come out. Accordingly,
when about one hundred and twenty had entered the
yard, this group of naked malignity began the attack with
desperate fierceness; the Americans, unsuspicious of an attack,
were of course unarmed, and at first could make no
resistance; but after recovering from the surprise which so
sudden an attack had created, they made an attempt to rally;
but the Frenchmen cutting off their retreat into the prison and
preventing those within from joining or rendering any assistance,
soon caused the Americans to fall a prey to their superior
number. Before the guards could interfere to prevent the
further proceedings, the Americans were mostly stabbed or
knocked down with heavy stones, and mangled in a most
shocking manner. What would have been the issue, had not
the guards entered, and by charging on both parties put a stop
to the battle, is difficult to tell. On examining the wounded,
(fortunately none were killed,) it appeared that about twenty
on both sides were badly, and many others slightly wounded.
The former were taken to the hospital, and though apparently
dangerous, in a short time all recovered. Captain
Cotgrave immediately informed the Board of Transport of this
unhappy event; but painted it in such dark colors on the side
of the Americans, that the Board gave answer, that the Americans
were totally different from all other men, and unfit to live<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
in any society. “If the household be devils, what is the master
of the house?” Did not the Americans descend from
England?</p>

<p>The yard of No. 4 was ordered to be divided, which was
done by a wall fifteen feet high, which cut off all communication
with the Americans, and their late meager associates.
This act, though it seemed to have been done to injure the
Americans, certainly created no regret; for instead of doing
them an injury, it was a great relief to be disencumbered of
that outcast tribe.</p>

<p>A spark of momentary joy may burst through the darkest
clouds of grief, and hope for a moment make us forget our
miseries. On the twenty-ninth of this month, Captain Cotgrave
received orders to remove one hundred and twenty
Americans from this prison to Chatham, which was to be the
complement of a cartel ship then lying at that place; this
embraced the greater part of the prisoners captured before
January, 1813. There remained of those captured before and
after that time, 1200 at Chatham, 400 at Stapleton, and a few
less than 500 at Dartmoor, some on board the prison ships, and
a number of officers on parole at Ashburton. The greater
part of these had been delivered up from ships of war.</p>

<p>At the close of this month, forty-five were found to have
entered the service of the enemy, and fifteen had died at this
place, seven or eight at Chatham, and not one at Stapleton.</p>

<p>At the commencement of August, we found ourselves limited
and very much straitened in our regulations. We were
not permitted to go out of the yard. A more alarming scene
of distress than any we had before experienced, now presented
itself before us, and death seemed to be the inevitable lot of
every man.</p>

<p>The King of Terrors daily reached forth his inexorable
hand, and removed the sufferer from the pale of this clay tenement;
for the small-pox had got among the prisoners, and its
ravages were so alarming, that every prisoner expected each
day would be his last; for numbers died daily.</p>

<p>The prisoners who remained able, collected themselves together,
and formed a committee of correspondence, who, by
bribing the guards, conveyed letters daily to Mr. Beasley;
particularly describing their situation, that they were almost
naked, and defrauded by the Contractor of half their rations,
which before were but one-third enough. That the small-pox<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
had got among them, and numbers died daily—that they were
covered with <i>animalcula</i>, and unless he could do something for
their relief, they must all perish together.</p>

<p>To these complaints he paid no kind of attention, neither
came to see whether they were true or false, nor sent any answer
either written or verbal.</p>

<p>The reader can easily figure to himself what must have
been our feelings, when five hundred men, closely confined in
one apartment, with that mortal epidemic among them without
any assistance, or possibility of escape.</p>

<p>The evil must lie somewhere; we were in doubt whether
to believe it was the will of the general government, of the
people at large of this country, or whether it was not entirely
the fault of our agent, in not seeing that all the officers in
whose immediate care we were, acted the honest part in the
performance of those duties, which both this government and
that of the United States had intrusted to them. It was not a
general thing, and the evil was near at hand. The prisoners
at Halifax fared well; they did not, nor could not, complain;
prisoners in other places in England were tolerably well provided
for.</p>

<p>After so many fruitless applications to our agent, we despaired
of any relief from that quarter, and then made application
to Captain Cotgrave, and demanded of him, what provisions
the government of England made for prisoners of war,
when neglected by their own government. He gave us every
opportunity to search out the fault, by producing the following
printed rules and regulations, made by the Transport Board.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The honorable Transport Board have made arrangements
with certain agents or contractors, to supply all prisoners of
war, as follows:</p>

<p>Each prisoner to receive per day, for five days in the week,
one and a half pounds of coarse brown bread; one-half pound
of beef, including the bone; one-third of an ounce of barley;
the same quantity of salt; one-third of an ounce of onions;
and one pound of turnips. The residue of the week, the usual
allowance of bread; one pound of pickled fish, and just
a sufficient quantity of coals to cook the same. These to be
served out daily by the contractors.</p>
</div>

<p>We watched the contractor, and found he weighed all the
articles at once, neat weight; and saw him scrimp the weight,
to fill his pocket out of the prisoners’ bellies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>On beef days, the whole is thrown into a large copper;
when it is sufficiently boiled, the bone is taken out, and each
mess, consisting of six, receives twenty-seven ounces of beef,
and one gallon and one pint of soup.</p>

<p>On the fish days, every mess boiled their potatoes and fish
in a net made of rope-yarn, that they might have it separately
to themselves; after it was boiled, it was taken up in wooden
buckets, with which each mess were provided; and each prisoner,
being also furnished with a wooden spoon, sets round the
bucket, on the wet floor, and makes a fierce attack.</p>

<p>After making these, and some other demands, which we
considered ourselves entitled to, most of which were immediately
granted, but some delayed, as we shall note hereafter,
our sufferings were somewhat relieved.</p>

<p>Could not these have been removed by our agent long before?
We find but few men so honest that they do not need
looking to sometimes by those who are interested in their honesty.
These contractors would have been as honest as many
other men, with sharp looking after. Was it not, then, the
duty of Mr. Beasley to see that the prisoners had what the
government of England allowed them? If it was not, what
was his duty? Was he sent there, as the log of wood in the
fable was sent by Jupiter into the pond, to be god for the frogs?</p>

<p>We found, by the printed regulations delivered us by Capt.
Cotgrave, the government allowed each prisoner a hammock,
one blanket, one horse-rug, and a bed, containing four pounds
of flocks; these articles too were to serve us two years. By
the same regulations, the prisoners were to receive for clothing,
every eighteen months, one yellow round-about jacket, one
pair of pantaloons, and a waistcoat of the same materials, as the
government of England allow for their soldiers; and one pair
of shoes and one shirt, every nine months. The shirt, though
coarse, was a change which we had not had for a long time
before. All these we demanded and received; we also received
a woollen cap, which was to serve us eighteen months.</p>

<p>I cannot leave this subject without some little description of
several of the articles of clothing. I will begin with the cap,
and take them in their natural order, from head to foot.</p>

<p>The cap was woollen, about an inch thick, and seemed to
have been spun in a rope-walk, but much coarser than common
rope-yarn. The jacket was not large enough to meet
around the smallest of us, although reduced to mere skeletons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
by such continued fasting; the sleeves came about half way
down the arm, and the hand stuck out like a spade; the waistcoat
was short—it would not meet before, nor down to the pantaloons—thus
leaving a space between of three or four inches;
the pantaloons, which were as tight as our skin itself, came
down to the middle of the shin. The shoes, which was the
pedestal for all the ornaments above, were made of list, interwoven
and fastened to pieces of wood an inch and a half thick.
The figure we made in this dress was no common one.</p>

<p>“My friends, were you admitted to see this sight, could you
keep from laughing?” When you see us tackled, and put
upon runners—skeletons as we were.</p>

<p>By the regulations handed us, we also found that the Board
allowed a sweeper to every hundred men, to sweep and keep
clean the prison, who was to be taken from among the prisoners,
and allowed by the government three pence per day; and
one out of every two hundred was allowed four pence halfpenny
a day for cooking. In like manner, a barber had three
pence; and the nurses in the hospital, six pence a day. All
these offices were occupied by Frenchmen, as was also the
employments in the mechanic arts at six pence per day.</p>

<p>During this month great numbers died of the small-pox, and
some of other diseases. Several entered the king’s service.
Suspicions had arisen, that several taken in arms against Great
Britain, were British subjects; they were consequently taken
out, and charged with having committed high treason. That
they were taken in arms against Great Britain, was not denied;
but that they were her subjects, which was the most
essential part of the charge, could not be proved; they were
consequently acquitted, and remanded to prison.</p>

<p>We had but one clear day during the whole month of August.</p>

<p>September commenced, and we remained in the situation
just described. The prisoners continued very sickly.</p>

<p>Men, otherwise commonly honest, when reduced to extreme
necessity, naturally resort to the commission of crimes. It is
a maxim strikingly true, that “hunger will break through a
stone wall;” and it is equally true, that it will break through
all moral obligation. Honesty and integrity are but mere chimeras
in dire necessity. Such was our situation, that it resembled
more a state of nature than a civilized society. Petty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
larcenies were daily committed among the prisoners; brothers
and the most intimate friends stealing from each other. To
provide a remedy against this evil, we appointed a legislative
body, to form a code of laws for the punishment of all such
misdemeanors. A tribunal was also formed to try and convict
all criminals according to law and evidence. Many were tried,
found guilty, and sentenced to receive twenty-four lashes
equally as severe as is given at the gangway of a man-of-war
ship.</p>

<p>To show the force of habit, though it is a vicious one, we
will give the reader a striking example. Some of the prisoners
were so attached to chewing tobacco, that they sold all their
day’s allowance of beef to the French at the gate, to purchase
one chew. They sometimes sold this allowance to buy soap
enough to wash one shirt, but this was only enduring one evil
to remedy a worse.</p>

<p>By letters received from our fellow-prisoners on board the
Crowned Prince, and the Nassau, prison ships at Chatham, we
received information that the Americans were distributed
among the French prisoners on board the several different
ships at that place, and very severely used; that they had
vainly addressed Mr. Beasley, and that several had died and
numbers entered the British service.</p>

<p>By letters received from Stapleton, we were informed of the
particulars of their march from Plymouth, which we promised
to give the reader in a former part of this work. The reader
will remember, that at the commencement of their journey,
they were allowed a shilling a day for traveling expenses, and
on their way, they had to pay three pence a night to lodge in
a barn, or some public building, on straw. As they were allowed
a shilling only, this took one-quarter of the whole.
With much ado they reached Stapleton; they found the prison
at that place well constructed for the convenience of the prisoners,
within a short distance of the city of Bristol; which is
the third city in England, and situated in Somersetshire, at
the conflux of the river Avon, with the small stream of the
Froom, about ten miles from the mouth of the Severn; these,
and several other small tributary streams, running through a
fertile country, bring into market all kinds of provisions and
fruits common to the country, which are sold at a much cheaper
rate than at most other places in the kingdom. From these
sources, the market at Stapleton, which is kept every day at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
the prison, is supplied with all kinds of market produce. On
their arrival they found five thousand French prisoners.
There are three prisons enclosed and garrisoned in the same
manner as those at Dartmoor; they were distributed among
the French prisoners in the different prisons. They had also
written to Mr. Beasley several times, and informed him, that
their situation was bad, although much better than that at
Dartmoor, and required his attention. But he was determined
to take no notice. They therefore concluded, that no arrangement
was to be made for their exchange, or that any assistance
was to be offered from the government of the United States,
made necessity an excuse for entering the service of the enemy
of their country; which many did at that place.</p>

<p>How far this is a crime, when we consider the <i>quo animo</i>?
I shall take this opportunity to show what is the custom of nations,
and what appears to be the law of nature. It is said,
“If a person be under circumstances of actual force and constraint,
through a well-grounded apprehension of injury to his
life or person, this fear, or compulsion, will excuse his even
joining with either rebels or enemies in the kingdom, provided
he leaves them whenever he hath a safe opportunity.”</p>

<p>Now to return to Dartmoor. At a time when the prisoners
had despaired of any relief, and began to reconcile themselves
to their hard fate, they were very agreeably surprised to hear
that Mr. Reuben G. Beasley had condescended to visit them,
and then waited at the gate for admittance. The idea, that
their deliverer had come, diffused a general joy through the
whole prison, and “lighted up a smile in the aspect of woe.”
The soldiers and guards were ordered into the prison, and
turned out every man, both sick and well; overhauled the
hammocks, swept the prison, and opened the window-shutters:
all filth was removed and every thing made clean, for the first
time since our arrival. The guards were then stationed at
the door, to prevent any prisoner from going in, to have any
communication with the agent: we were told, that no man
could speak to him, or have any communication with him
whatever. At three o’clock, the entrance of Mr. Beasley was
announced by the turnkeys. We arranged ourselves in the
yard, in anxious expectation of the glad tidings he might bring.
He appeared, attended with his clerks, the clerks of the prison,
and a very numerous train of soldiers. As he entered the
yard of the prison, we presented a frightful appearance, in our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
yellow uniform, wooden shod, and meager, lantern-jaws. He
felt the sight, and seemed much surprised at the group. We
stood in silent expectation; he moved along to the prison;
but how were our feelings damped at this moment! when we
expected from him the language of consolation and relief, he
only uttered, in a careless tone to his clerks, “that he did not
think that the number had been so great!”</p>

<p>He entered, and cast his eyes around the cold wet walls of
the prison, and seemed to say, with a shrug of his shoulders,
“I am glad that it is not I that is to live here.” When he
returned, we were determined to have some conversation with
him. We therefore collected round him, demanded what arrangements
were made for our relief, whether we must expect
to remain in our present condition? Telling him, that if we
must, that we could not long survive; and presenting him
with a list of names of those who had already entered the
king’s service; and telling him all the particulars of our distress.
He then opened his mouth, and said, he had no power
to do any thing, nor any funds to do with; but he would do
his endeavor. We asked him the cause of so great a difference
in the treatment of the prisoners here and at Halifax?
There they had all the necessaries and conveniences of life;
here we had none of them. We asked him to whom we should
apply for relief in future? We told him we had been to great
expense, heretofore, and much trouble, in conveying letters to
him, while he had not thought fit to answer. He said the exchange
of prisoners was stopped for the present year, and that
we could not expect to have our condition altered. With these
unwelcome observations, he went immediately out of the gates,
and left us to all the wretchedness of despair.</p>

<p>We returned into the prison, lamenting our fate. Some
cursed the day they were born; some, the day of their captivity;
some attributed all their sufferings to the inattention of
the Agent, and others, to the government of the United States.
We retired to our hammocks, and gave vent to our feelings in
sighs and tears.</p>

<p>The thought that we must forego all the endearments of life,
and perish together, in a foreign country, among our enemies,
was too much for our feelings to bear. The groans of the disconsolate
and sick filled the whole prison. Our Agent not
empowered to act, and without funds! We had now only to
look to heaven, whose will it was to bring us to this state, and
through whose mercy alone we could hope to find relief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>The winter was fast approaching, and the cold upon this
mountain was very severe. The small-pox still continued,
and the measles had got among us, and great numbers were
sick with both diseases. The next day, conceiving they had
no other alternative, a great number entered the British service;
rather hazarding the chance of escape, and censure of
their country, than to trust life to the perils of this prison.</p>

<p>Although I am a little before some part of my story, I must
not forget to mention, that about the middle of September, another
draft was taken from the Hector, now at Hamoaze, near
Plymouth; among which were the crew of the United States’
brig Argus, taken by the Pelican. One Robinson, who had
belonged to the Argus, had declared, that several of the crew
of that vessel were British subjects. And immediately seventeen,
whom he pointed out, were taken and conveyed on board
the receiving ship, St. Salvador, and put into close confinement,
there to await their trial and execution, should they be
found guilty. The boatswain, and a number of others, wounded
in the action, were conveyed to the hospital, in Mill-prison
at Plymouth.</p>

<p>At the end of this month a great number had died, and
numbers down with all complaints, prevalent in crowded
camps or prisons. The weather much like the month before.</p>

<p>By letters, received the tenth of October, from Chatham and
Stapleton, we were informed, that Mr. Beasley had visited
them, and his conduct and language at those places were the
same as at this depot. By the letters from Chatham, we had
an account of eighteen making their escape, by cutting a hole
through the side of the Crown Prince, at that place; that afterwards
the guard were increased and more vigilant.</p>

<p>On the sixteenth, Capt. Cotgrave gave orders, by directions
of the Transport Board, to have all these outcast Frenchmen
in No. 4 collected. This took four hundred and thirty-six
from the prison, and much relieved us.</p>

<p>Before I proceed with the remainder of my story, I cannot
but here observe the strange effect habit and corruption
have in changing our common nature. They had been many
of them ten years in this prison in a state of perfect nudity,
and had been so for many years; had slept upon the bare
stone-floor without covering for many years, till the flesh had
acquired a sort of hardness, like the stones themselves.</p>

<p>This was the effect of gambling, which had acquired a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
greater power over them than hunger or nakedness. Whenever
they were supplied with clothing, they never put them
on, but turned to gambling, till they had lost the whole. They
had often been supplied by their countrymen in the other prisons,
with hammocks, beds, and clothing: but they no sooner
got possession of them, than they went to the grating of the
other prisons, and sold them, and gambled the whole away. It
is difficult for the mind to conceive, how human beings could
be possessed of fewer virtues or more vices; or how they
could any further change their common nature to a bestial
one without the assistance of a Supreme Being. It is a remarkable
fact, that these men (if they yet deserve the name)
were more healthy, though stark naked winter and summer
for ten years, than any prisoners at this depot; though to the
number of nine thousand.</p>

<p>The French prisoners never received any assistance from
the French government, but depended entirely on the British.
Though I cannot praise the general acts of the latter government,
nor am I disposed to flatter; yet they did a humane act
which certainly deserves credit. They took these four hundred
and thirty-six Frenchmen out of this prison, clothed them
well, and put them on board a prison-ship at Plymouth, separate
from all other men, except their guards, who carefully
watched them, and prevented them from disposing of their
clothes, and kept them decent during the remainder of their
captivity.</p>

<p>In the six prisons, occupied by the French prisoners, is carried
on almost every branch of the mechanic arts. They resemble
little towns, being mostly soldiers; every man has his
separate occupation; his work-shop, his store-house, his coffee-house,
his eating-house, &amp;c., &amp;c.; he is employed in some
business or other.</p>

<p>There are many gentlemen of large fortunes here, who
having broke their parole, were committed to close confinement.
These were able to support themselves in a genteel
manner; though they were prisoners, they drew upon their
bankers in other parts of Europe.</p>

<p>They manufactured shoes, hats, hair and bone-work. They
likewise, at one time, carried on a very lucrative branch of
manufactory. They forged notes on the Bank of England, to
the amount of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling;
and made so perfect an imitation, that the cashier could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
discover the forgery; and very much doubted the possibility
of such imitation.</p>

<p>They also carried on the coining of silver, to a very considerable
advantage; they had men constantly employed outside
of the yard, to collect all the Spanish dollars they could, and
bring into prison. Out of every dollar they made eight
smooth English shillings; equally as heavy, and passed as
well as any in the kingdom.</p>

<p>Whether they are constituted by nature to endure hardships,
or so long confinement has got them wonted to live in prisons,
I will not venture to say; but they really seem easy under it,
live well, and make money to lay up.</p>

<p>They drink, sing and dance, talk of their women in the
day-time, and, like Horace, dream of them at night; but I
have not heard of any issue by this visionary connexion. But
the Americans have not that careless volatility, like the cockle
in the fable, to sing and dance when their house is on fire over
them.</p>

<p>When any one has committed a crime, or becomes a nuisance
among them, he is condemned, and sent to No. 4, to remain
during his captivity; so the Americans must dwell
among the damned.</p>

<p>On the twenty-eighth, a large corps of French prisoners,
taken at the battle near St. Sebastian, in Spain, arrived at this
depot, and took their abode among the other Frenchmen. At
this time, a very mortal distemper prevailed among the French
prisoners, that carried off eight or ten every day.</p>

<p>When any one dies in the hospital, his body is removed to
the dead-house, a place made for that purpose; after being
stripped of his clothes, shirt and all, (which go to the government,
or the nurse of the deceased,) the body is then opened,
to learn the nature of the disease; it is afterwards, quite naked,
put into a coarse shell, made of rough pine boards, and remains
in the dead-house for several days, till a number is collected
in the same manner: when a sufficient number is
heaped together to call their attention, a large hole is dug back
of the prison, and all thrown in together, without form or ceremony.</p>

<p>The hospital department consists of a surgeon, two assistants,
and as many male nurses as are necessary. Every
morning, at nine o’clock, orders are given, by the ringing of
bells, that every prisoner, wanting relief or medical aid, must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
repair to the hospital to be examined, and receive prescriptions;
he then returns to the prison, where he remains till carried in
again.</p>

<p>The sickness among the Americans somewhat abated the
latter end of this month. Many entered the king’s service.
As the recruiting officers receive a premium on every soldier
they enlist for his majesty, they used every inducement in
their power. An officer belonging to a Dutch regiment,
thought it a good opportunity to <i>mock de gildt</i>, entered the yard,
and began to solicit men to enlist into the regiments to go
against the United States; but the Americans took this the
greatest insult, that such a booby should think of getting <i>them</i>
to fight against their country; they soon hustled Mynheer out
of the yard, and frustrated all his hopes of gain.</p>

<p>The majority of the prisoners used every means in their
power to prevent our countrymen from entering the enemy’s
service. We often, on discovering the intention of any one to
enlist into their service, fastened him up to the grating and
flogged him severely, and threatened to despatch them secretly
if they did not desist; but attempts were vain; they justified
themselves on the plea of self-preservation; that there
was a possibility of escaping and saving their lives; and if
detected by their country, their death was distant, but here it
was speedy and certain.</p>

<p>Capt. Cotgrave, perceiving the great exertions that were
made to prevent any entering his majesty’s service, adopted a
plan to encourage it. When any one was known to be disposed
that way, he would send him a line, and invite him to
come to the guard-house, where the other prisoners could have
no communication with him: here he was kept till a number
sufficient for a draft was collected, then sent to Plymouth, and
put on board a receiving ship, and received their bounty.
About one draft a month commonly took place.</p>

<p><i>November.</i>—The weather is much similar to that of the
State of New York at the same season; rain, snow, and hail,
almost every day; the prisoners without stockings, and many
had been so unthoughtful of the future as to sell their jackets
to buy food; and the whole dress allowed them was no more
than sufficient in the most clement season, the prisons being
always damp, and the weather very rainy. We were allowed
no fuel; some had also sold their hammocks, blankets, and
beds, to the French. These thoughtless wretches were now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
obliged to sleep, or rather lie, upon the stones the whole night,
and when there happened a fine day, which was seldom, it
was with the greatest difficulty the guards could rouse them
from this stupor, and get them into the yard. We dreaded the
winter.</p>

<p>We received letters from our fellow-prisoners at other prisons,
informing us that they had applied to Mr. Beasley, and
advising us to do the same, which we had already done; they
wished to be informed of our situation; this was done in
poetry.</p>

<p>The time had now expired for relieving the present guard;
this being done, its place was supplied by a Scotch regiment.
Sympathy glowed in the minds of these gallant fellows; no
nobler act has nature done than form the heart that feels for
others’ woes. They felt for ours, and though enemies, at the
peril of life relieved them; it was an act that superior beings
might behold with admiration. Touched with this tie of nature,
when ordered to bring out every prisoner into the yard,
sick or naked, they often pitied him, gave him some relief, and
left him behind; though ordered to cut him down or run him
through, if he offered to remain.</p>

<p>They supplied us with late papers, and gave us all the account
they could of the affairs in America. They cheered us
with the agreeable account of the Essex, and her success in
the South Seas: we had friends that pitied us, though they
could not greatly relieve us.</p>

<p>About this time a few prisoners from Plymouth, lately captured,
and lately from the States, arrived at this depot.</p>

<p>The news they bring of the success of the American arms,
animates every soul, and for a moment we forgot our troubles.
By them the account of the Boxer and Enterprise, the complete
victory of Commodore Perry on Lake Erie is given us,
but no hope of exchange or prospect of peace. No alteration
in our treatment by government; the prisoners not permitted
out of yard No. 4. The French go any where through the
several prisons; go to market, but the Americans not permitted
to. The government grew more strict in their enlistments;
they would receive none but regularly bred sailors, and no invalids.</p>

<p>At the latter end of this month a great number of prisoners,
taken under the American flag, claimed a release from confinement,
and showed that they owed their allegiance by birth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
to powers in alliance with Great Britain. To Holland, Sweden,
and other places, and are released on account of their
neutrality.</p>

<p>Weather very cold all the month. The prisoners without
shoes or clothes, obliged to keep their hammock. Fewer
deaths than the month before. Yard covered with snow.</p>

<p><i>December.</i>—Cold increasing. Prisoners in despair. Capt.
Cotgrave ordered the prisoners to turn out every morning at
the hour of nine, and stand in the yard till the guards counted
them; this generally took more than an hour. Many of the
prisoners were without stockings, and some without shoes, and
many without jackets. They cut up their blankets to wrap up
their feet and legs, that they might be able to endure the cold
and snow while they were going through this ceremony. We
complained to the captain of this practice, and told him it was too
severe for the prisoners to endure; he said it was his orders,
and as agent he must obey them. We reminded him of several
instances that must shock the heart of every feeling man,
that he himself was knowing to the day before. Several of
these naked men, chilled, and benumbed with cold, and being
half starved, fell down lifeless in his presence, and in presence
of the guards and turnkeys. This was a cruelty which exceeded
murder in any shape whatever; to expose the naked
helpless prisoner to perish in the pitiless blast of this bleak
mountain, was an act that made our hearts recoil with horror.</p>

<p>We remonstrated with the infamous author, but all our supplications
and remonstrances were in vain; the wretch was
inexorable; his feelings had become callous by continuing so
long among the sufferings of the French prisoners. After
these men fell down in the yard, they were taken up and carried
to the hospital, and with some difficulty were restored to
life again; they were then immediately sent back to prison,
there to lie on the stone floor without bed or covering.</p>

<p>At this treatment I presume the reader will not so much
wonder that so many died, as he will that any could live
at all.</p>

memory, will ever be engraven, in odious characters, on the
mind of every American who witnessed his unparalleled
cruelty.</p>

<p>On the 22d of this month the iron sceptre was wrested from
his hand, and placed beyond his reach. A new agent, Capt.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
Thos. G. Shortland, at this time superseded Cotgrave. Shortland
was a man whose feelings had not yet grown callous by
being familiarized with human misery, and at his first arrival
he was shocked at the scenes of our misery, which presented
themselves in every shape before him; touched with compassion,
he could not continue the cruel practice of counting over
the prisoners every morning in the yard. He countermanded
the order which his predecessor pretended to have been commanded
to put in force. He declared to us that he would do
all in his power to procure us some relief from his government;
that he himself would do all he could in his situation
as agent, to assist us; he very politely and kindly offered to
forward to Mr. Beasley, or to the Congress of the United States,
any communication or petition which might procure us any relief.
He stated in feeling terms to the Board of Transport the
real condition of the American prisoners. He ordered the
doctors’ assistants to visit the persons daily, and to remove to
the hospital all the sick who had before been refused admittance.
He granted permission for two of the prisoners to
attend the market each day, and purchase such little necessary
articles as they were able, such as soap, potatoes, tobacco,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>These relaxations in the morning of his power seemed to
promise a bright day; but the noon began to grow a little obscure,
and, we are sorry to say, at last went down in blood,
and left obscure the bright traits of the morning.</p>

<p>The weather was incredibly cold upon this mountain; the
moor, as far as the eye could extend, was covered with frost
and snow; the prison walls, by being continually damp, had
become like solid ice, and the prisoners obliged to keep their
hammocks, for being allowed no fire, had no other means to
keep themselves warm.</p>

<p>The rigor of treatment seemed somewhat relaxed; for our
friendly officers and Scotch guards gave us as much relief and
consolation as their station would permit, and we endeavored
to cultivate their friendship.</p>

<p>According to Capt. Shortland’s advice, and our own necessities,
we again made application to Mr. Beasley. In this letter
we informed him that we were fully of opinion that the
United States would sanction any reasonable overtures he
should make to prevent her citizens from starving or perishing
for want in a foreign prison; that his being agent for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
United States was sufficient power, and he had a right to
pledge the credit of the United States, which was amply sufficient
to procure any sum requisite for our relief. We farther
stated, in the most unequivocal terms, that unless some relief
was given us soon, that the prisoners had come to a unanimous
and final determination to offer our services <i>en masse</i> to the
British government, and at the same time transmit to the
United States a copy of all letters from us to him, and set
forth to Congress all our reasons for so doing, which would
most undoubtedly cast all the blame on him.</p>

<p>This month ended with increased cold, and snow falling
daily. The prisoners did not go out of their hammocks, only
at dinner, which was the only meal they had.</p>

<p><i>January, 1814.</i>—The year commences with as cold weather
as we ever experienced in the city of New York; the buckets
in the prison, in the short space of four hours, froze ten or
twelve quarts to a solid, and the prisoners must inevitably have
frozen, were not the hammocks placed so near together as to
communicate the animal heat from one man to another.</p>

<p>The running stream that supplied the prison froze solid, and
the weather was allowed to be colder than it had been for fifty
years before.</p>

<p>On the 1st the snow was two feet on the level, and began to
snow again; the cold somewhat abated, and it continued snowing
the greater part of the time till the nineteenth; it had now
got to be four feet on the level, and the drifts in the yards as
high as the prison walls (fifteen feet), the water all frozen, and
the prisoners obliged to eat snow for drink. The guards were
all obliged to leave the walls and retire to the guard-house;
no sentry on duty except in the barracks.</p>

<p>At midnight; this dreary night, eight prisoners, thinking to
take advantage of the night to make their escape, as no sentries
were in sight, formed a ladder, and with it ascended and
descended the first wall directly against the guard-house, and
in ascending the second, the soldiers in the guard-house discovered
them, and apprehended seven; the eighth got quite
over the wall, and made his escape. These seven were taken
to the guard-house and there put into the black-hole, which is
the place for prisoners that attempt to make their escape: the
weather extremely cold, was likely to prove their last. But
the fifth day they were removed to the cachot, and remained
on two-thirds allowance, sleeping on straw for ten days. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
prisoners, soldiers, and officers, were now furnished with salt
provisions, which are always kept at the prison against any
emergency of this kind. Every man upon the mountain was
now much alarmed, as only ten days’ stock of provision was
in reserve on the mountain, and there were now upwards of
nine thousand French and American prisoners, besides fifteen
hundred soldiers and officers, doctors, and a numerous train of
turnkeys.</p>

<p>The back house was at some distance, and the snow drifted
in from ten to fifteen feet deep; this formed an impassable
barrier; but Capt. Shortland, at the head of two hundred
French prisoners, all the horse of the garrison, and clerks,
turnkeys, &amp;c., after working one whole day, shovelled a passage
sufficient for wagons to pass. For should the weather
continue as cold as it then was, all communication between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
that place and Plymouth, whence the provisions were brought,
being totally stopped by the great depth of snow, they were in
danger of starving. On the twenty-fifth the weather began to
moderate and the snow began to dissolve.</p>

<p>The eighth man, who made his escape, had wandered over
the moor, through the deep snow, till by chance he came to a
single hut on the moor; the peasants suspected him to be a
prisoner, as no person could travel in such tedious weather,
and after examining him some time, he confessed he had made
his escape from prison. They brought him back, and he received
the same sentence as his unsuccessful companions.
During his absence, all the officers and prisoners were much
concerned at the miserable fate they were confident he must
have shared, as it was impossible for him long to live, for if he
survived the storm, he must starve in a few days: but it
seemed he had reached the hut on the second day, without being
frozen in any part. The officers and guards considering
his attempt so bold and fearless of death, and showed such a
noble longing for liberty, were really sorry to see him brought
back, and declared that a man so dauntless as to dare such
perils, deserved his liberty, and a reward; and had it been in
their power he would have been released.</p>

<p>Here I must beg leave, though I fear the repetition of our
distress may tire the reader, to appeal to the feeling of my fellow-citizens,
at this time at ease beyond the great Atlantic:
what would you have done, could you have seen your fellow-citizens
at Dartmoor, the coldest winter there has been for half
a century, without fire or light, during the night, without
stockings, and many without shoes, and nearly naked, half
starved, buried in snow, upon the top of an uninhabited and
uncultivated mountain, the camp distemper among them, and
overrun with vermin; great numbers dying, and death grimly
threatening every man?</p>

<p>Say, would you not have pitied and flew to their relief, and
left the gay circle of your amusement?</p>

<p>But few entered the service of the enemy this month; the
weather being so very cold, they dreaded the removal to
Plymouth.</p>

<p><i>February, 1814.</i>—The weather was more moderate, and snow
dissolving very fast.</p>

<p>We received a letter from Mr. Beasley, for the first time
since our confinement, which had continued ever since April,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
1813. This is the first scrap in writing any prisoner in England
had ever received from him. It reads as follows:—“Fellow-citizens,
I am authorized by the government of the
United States to allow you one penny halfpenny per day, for
the purpose of procuring you tobacco and soap, which will
commence being paid from the first day of January, and I
earnestly hope it will tend towards a great relief in your present
circumstances. I likewise would advise you to appoint a
committee, by which means you can convey to me any intelligence
through the Board of Transport.” Immediately after
the reception of this letter, we formed a committee of six, five
besides myself, who were to see that every man had his money,
and gave a receipt to Capt. Shortland, who was authorized by
Mr. Beasley to pay it.</p>

<p>In conformity to these arrangements, we received, on the 5th
of February, three halfpence sterling per day (less than three
cents). This money was to be paid every thirty-two days:
as one month had passed from the time it was to commence,
we received the payment for all that time. The day’s allowance
of cash would purchase two pounds of potatoes, or three
chews of tobacco, which latter was five shillings and six-pence
sterling all over England. We returned to Mr. Beasley a letter,
acknowledging the receipt of the money, and stated the
great alteration this little attention had made in the prisoners;
every man was animated beyond description to find himself
again acknowledged by the United States; that before that
time they concluded that during the twelve months they had
been immured in prisons, so far from their country, that they
were entirely forgotten by her, and that she did not any more
remember she had such sons as those at Dartmoor. The
gloom that had so long clouded their countenances now began
a little to disappear, and the prospect a little brightened, and
we had hopes of life; but still our nakedness was grievous to
bear. In a letter of thanks to our government, through the
medium of Mr. Beasley, we stated every particular of our
situation, our past and our present sufferings. We stated to
him that it could not be possible that the Congress of the
United States had allowed that small sum for those few articles,
and had not made any provision for clothing, which
ought to have occupied their first attention, for without clothes
we did not need soap. We must, therefore, conclude this sum
was allowed by himself out of the United States funds, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
that we were extremely grateful for it; that the United States,
were they acquainted with all the particulars of our situation,
would make immediately all requisite arrangements for
clothing, which his Honor Mr. Beasley must be well satisfied
we were much in need of. After this correspondence with
Mr. Beasley, we formed resolutions to expel all gambling, and
were fully confident that some greater arrangement would be
made for us.</p>

<p>Before this time seventy-five had entered the British service
out of nine hundred Americans at this depot; but now
not a man mentioned such a thing; he could not be persuaded
to do it. This shows how much effect so little attention of
Mr. Beasley had upon the prisoners. We, on the 22d of this
month, petitioned to have the black prisoners separated from
the white, for it was impossible to prevent these fellows from
stealing, although they were seized up and flogged almost
every day. Our petition was granted, and we greatly relieved,
and the blacks, ninety in number, occupied the upper
stories.</p>

<p>The weather greatly moderated, but vast quantities of rain
fell. The British government made an order to release all
prisoners belonging to the King of Prussia, taken under the
flag of the United States. A few days after they issued a
general order, that all prisoners belonging to any nation with
whom she was in alliance, under whatever flag they were
taken, should be released. This order released many Americans,
who were acquainted with different languages, and
could make a plausible story: the Yankees were citizens of
all nations whose language they knew.</p>

<p>At the close of this month, we received letters from our
countrymen on board the prison-ships at Chatham, and likewise
those at Stapleton, informing us that they had received
the same allowance of three halfpence per day at both places,
at the same time that we received it. They also sent a copy
of a letter of Mr. Beasley, which is the same as the one already
mentioned. They also mentioned that they had had a
very severe winter, but it was not as severe there as at this
place. The prisoners at Chatham, among whom were great
numbers that had been released from the British service during
the winter, had received their wages and prize money;
which, as is usual with a generous-hearted sailor, they distributed
for the good of the whole. At the depot at Stapleton, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
American prisoners were distributed among the French, who,
in many instances, were very kind.</p>

<p>On the last day of this month, by papers conveyed to us by
our friendly Scotch guards, we found an account of Captain
Porter’s taking two large South-Seamen, mounting 16 guns,
and upwards of fifty men each. He says they surrendered
without firing a gun; that they were taken by the boats of the
Essex, and speaks rather slightly of the courage of the British
on those occasions.</p>

<p>In March the weather began to be mild; the snow was now
mostly gone; the prisoners could remain in the yard the
greater part of the day, and their spirits were much revived
at the expectation of receiving their penny halfpenny per day
in a lump; but this was prolonged, and the prisoners began to
despond, as they had received no information from Mr. Beasley
since the second of last month; but on the fifteenth orders
were issued to pay it, and glad enough were we, for every
man considered this little payment his sole support.</p>

<p>The gates were now left open, and we had all the privileges
of the market which were allowed the French; we were allowed
to go through all the prisons, visit the French officers,
and gain all the information we could from London papers,
which many of the French officers took daily. The French
prisoners were much concerned at the fate of their country
when they learned the success of the allies, as every prisoner
had been in the army or navy of Bonaparte, and were much
attached to the Emperor.</p>

<p>Having received no letters from Mr. Beasley, we now gave
up all hope of exchange, gave ourselves up to our condition,
and resigned our destiny into the hands of Heaven to deal with
us as he pleased, during the long captivity which we believed
we had to endure; for, seeing the English papers filled with
accounts of the success of their arms in Europe, and every
day declaring their full confidence of a complete conquest of
America, we could not expect peace, though this boasting did
not frighten us, for we knew the strength and valor of the
American people.</p>

<p>On the 18th we established a coffee-house in our prison, as
the French had in theirs, and sold coffee at a penny a pint;
but you cannot think it very delicious when I inform you that
it could not be bought under two and three pence per pound,
and molasses seventy per hundred weight. At the same time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
some of the prisoners received money from home, and all
established themselves in some kind of business. Some established
themselves as tobacconists; others as potato merchants,
butter merchants, and indeed almost all kinds of merchandise
were carried on in our prison after we received our second
payment: we had “free trade and sailors’ rights.” We could
purchase any article of provision in the markets; coffee, sugar,
molasses, any thing the country afforded. The gates being
now opened, we traded with the French. We could buy
potatoes at six-pence a score, butter at one and six-pence per
pound; and as for meat, that was out of the question altogether.
Every man began to use all the economy he could,
which he perceived the French did. Some went to work for
the French at making straw flats, at which they could earn
one penny per day. Others were employed in making list
shoes, some in the manufactory of hair bracelets, necklaces,
&amp;c.; while great numbers employed themselves in working
the bones we got out of the beef, in imitation of the French,
who were very ingenious, and would form the most admirable
and beautiful ships, plank, mast, and rig them all of bone.
The French, for their amusement, had regular plays in a
theatrical form, with very elegant scenery, once a month.
Hamlet’s ghost was an easy part to act, for they had only to
show their natural visage, being mere shadows themselves.
They had excellent music, and appropriate comic and tragic
dresses. They also had schools for teaching the arts and
sciences, dancing, fencing, and music, and each of these in
great perfection. As numbers of them were daily receiving
money from France, their prison was very rich. But No. 4,
where the sons of liberty had lived so long on the vapor of a
dungeon, when will the same be said of you? Perhaps some
victim as unhappy as myself, when some ten years have rolled
away, and the human mind, compelled by stern necessity to
invent, and I myself have found my <i>quietus</i> behind the prison-walls,
may tell a sorry story of splendid misery within your
gloomy gates.</p>

<p>During the whole month of March the weather was quite
mild, and the prisoners gained their health and strength
greatly. On the 21st we detected the contractor cheating us
in our rations, by giving scant weight. We immediately informed
Capt. Shortland of the fraud, who examined into the
fact, and had the cheating stopped, but gave the conduct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
of the contractor a very easy term, by saying it was a
mistake.</p>

<p>Towards the close of this month many of the Americans had
obtained some remnants of garments from the French, and
mostly all the boys had got into the employ of the French officers
as waiters. Many of these little victims of war were
under thirteen—and there were many old men above the age
of sixty imprisoned: both these classes it has been considered
contrary to the custom of nations to imprison. What use
could it be to sacrifice the aged or the child in a prison?</p>

<p>I had sailed for many years in the employment of merchants
of England, and had ever had a most exalted idea of the humanity
and generosity of that nation, but by woeful experience
I found I had been deceived. Many of my readers may, perhaps,
dispute the truth of what I have here asserted; but I
appeal to thousands of my countrymen, who will testify the
truth of what I have said, and thousands who have suffered
with me will say, that the pen of Homer or Milton would fall
short in describing the miseries of Dartmoor.</p>

<p>Though the weather was quite mild at the end of the month,
yet, as many of the prisoners were almost naked, they suffered
greatly for want of more clothing.</p>

<p>On the last day of this month we received a letter from Mr.
Beasley, being the second ever received at this depot from
him.</p>

<p>I shall commence the transactions of April by giving a copy
of the letter which we received the day before.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>Fellow-Citizens</i>,—
</p>

<p>In addition to the allowance of three halfpence per day,
which has heretofore been allowed, I shall make remittance to
Captain Shortland, to enable you to have coffee and sugar
twice a week, that is, the days on which your rations consist
of fish; my intention at first was to have the articles themselves
sent to be distributed, but it being suggested to me by
the committees at the other depots that the value in money
would be more serviceable to the prisoners, I have determined
to allow three-pence halfpenny per man, two days in the week,
being the value of those articles, and I hope the committee
will find means to ensure its being applied to the purpose intended.</p>

<p class="author">
Yours, &amp;c.,</p>
<p class="author2"><span class="smcap">R. G. Beasley</span>.
</p>
</div>

<p>With the letter was accompanied an additional allowance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
which augmented the sum to two pence halfpenny, and we
now received the sum of six and eight pence on the eighth.
This was to continue being paid monthly.</p>

<p>As it is natural to expect, this payment produced great
spirits and animation among the prisoners, and was as welcome
as a thousand pounds when we were free and had plenty.
With this money the prisoners purchased many little necessary
articles of clothing, such as shirts, shoes, trowsers, &amp;c., which
could be bought very cheap of the French, who always kept
stores of second-hand clothing, which were obtained from the
officers.</p>

<p>The weather was fine—for this place—and the prisoners
healthy; and, having obtained some clothes, and anticipating
the reception of more, began to be quite comfortable in their
situation, when we compare it to the distress of that cold winter
they had just passed through.</p>

<p>Our little salary seemed to command some respect from the
turnkeys, soldier-officers, and subalterns, who were themselves
as poor and meager as Romeo’s apothecary. It brought us
many indulgences, such as full liberty of the markets, which
before had been prohibited, and we compelled to purchase of
the French at the gratings. This was a great benefit to
us, for we could now trade with the country people much
cheaper.</p>

<p>To regulate our rations, we were also allowed to appoint a
committee of two, to attend at the store-house to see that the
contractor gave us weight in those articles allowed by the
Board.</p>

<p>The day after we received our payment, we received London
papers containing an official account of the allies entering
Paris, and the complete defeat and downfall of Bonaparte.
This news was a sore affliction to the French prisoners, who
were passionately attached to the Emperor, and not much less
galling to the Americans; for now some boasting pettimaitres
among the British officers would come into the yard, in the
most taunting, vile manner, to sport with the feelings of the
prisoners of both nations: “For,” said they, “we have conquered
France, and have not the least doubt but we shall
shortly completely reduce the United States to colonies of
Great Britain, and your haughty President become a mendicant
vagabond.” This insolence was too much for flesh and
blood to bear. They declared they could have peace on any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
terms they wished, and, although we were yet prisoners of
war, they considered us their subjects.</p>

<p>Such language to prisoners who could not resent it, showed
that the authors of it could be nothing better than the vilest
caitiffs, and could flow from nothing but the meanest of envy.</p>

<p>The French prisoners felt this conduct much more severe
than we; for the conquest was already made, and they were
obliged to look to a master whom they hated, to one who was
the choice of their enemies, Louis XVIII.</p>

<p>Many gentlemen visited the prison to congratulate those unfortunate
men on their being restored to liberty, and thought
that as they had been many of them confined from five to
eleven years, they would rejoice at the idea of liberty under
any monarch. They presented the prisoners with the old national
flag, and advised them to wear the white cockade; but
they declared, in the presence of those gentlemen, that they
would prefer staying in prison all their lifetime than to serve
any other master, or become subject to any other king than
Bonaparte, whom they loved. But the sequel will show how
lasting their determinations were, and how like they were to
their nation at large.</p>

<p>At this time to express their regret at the misfortune of
their beloved emperor, and their resentment to the proffered
flag and cockade of the new monarch, they came forward
every man, wearing the tri-colored cockade, and the white
ones on the heads of the dogs that ran about the yards. The
white flag they destroyed with great eagerness, in presence of
the visitors and great numbers of British officers standing on
the wall.</p>

<p>Shortly after this intelligence of the affairs of France, we
had letters from Chatham, which informed us that, since the
last from that place, there had arrived great numbers of prisoners
there, and that many were almost persuaded in their
own minds to enter the enemy’s service; that they had received
the additional allowance at the same time as ourselves.
On the 15th we were informed that there was a draft ready at
Plymouth, and would shortly be sent to this depot.</p>

<p>About this time a separate arrangement was made for allowing
the crew of the U. S. brig Argus half pay, to be received
monthly, and at the time the first payment was received, they
received clothing. This was an additional benefit to our prison,
as there were established in it a great number of shops for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
various branches of business; this money circulated within
ourselves, and every one derived some advantage.</p>

<p>The preliminaries of peace being agreed on at Paris, the
French prisoners, towards the close of the month, began to
make all preparation for leaving the prison, and once more
visiting their native country. The idea of returning to their native
land, their homes, and their wives, was too nicely interwoven
with the threads of their nature to be razed by that of
their aversion to the Bourbons. The change which was about
to take place in their situation had in it too many of the endearments
of life to be sacrificed for the love of any monarch.
The scenes of their youth, the places where they had spent so
many careless, pleasant days, the embraces of their friends,
all rushed upon their minds at once, and they could not forbear
the highest transports of joy. They went to leave all the
evils that men suffer in this life, and to embrace all the good
and blessings of it.</p>

<p>We had now an opportunity of procuring all the tools and
utensils of the mechanical arts which the French carried on.
And during their long imprisonment they had obtained almost
every article that could be named; all these articles we purchased,
and every man turned all his ingenuity to some branch
or other.</p>

<p>The weather being pleasant, and the prisoners healthy, they
bore their confinement with as much patience as could be expected.
By permission, towards the close of the month, they
established a beer-house, where small-beer was sold for two
pence halfpenny per pot.</p>

<p>On the last day of the month a school was established for
the instruction of the boys in the arts of reading, writing, and
common arithmetic; to maintain the school, the rate of tuition
was fixed at six pence per month per scholar, to be paid by
them.</p>

<p>May commenced, the weather was equally fine, but some
rain. In the bustle of the crowd, we almost forgot our situation;
the market square was crowded every day with people
of every description—some came for curiosity, others to trade,
and among the latter were many Jews, who brought clothing,
and many other articles which might be wanted by the French
for their journey. The French prisoners were all in confusion
making ready for their departure. The proposal was again
made to the French prisoners to hoist the white flag, and wear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
the insignia of Louis XVIII.; but they rejected it, and would not
listen to any argument. Now was the time to try the strength
of their attachment to the emperor, whom only they had sworn
to serve or die in prison. When the proposition was made to
them either to hoist the flag and wear the insignia, or remain
in prison till the last draft of prisoners in England, they then
immediately, but rather reluctantly, hoisted the white flag and
put on the cockade. But it was a grievous sight to them, and
they could not look at it but with the bitterest reflection, and
the most poignant regret; for they had for years endured all
the calamities and hardships of danger and war for the support
of their beloved emperor, who now must give place to
those they hated.</p>

<p>On the 10th a draft of Americans from Plymouth, about
170, in great distress, arrived at this depot, among whom were
the seventeen that were taken and put into close confinement
by the information of Robertson. They had been tried for
high treason by a court of judicature, but there not being sufficient
evidence on the part of the crown to support the charge,
they were acquitted, and sent to this prison, to be dealt by as
prisoners of war only. In the same draft were a number of
prisoners who had been released from British ships of war.</p>

<p>On the 15th we received our monthly pay; this came very
appropos, to enable us to buy all the furniture used by the
French at a very low price. On the same day Mr. Williams,
clerk to Mr. Beasley, and a Jew merchant of London, Mr.
Jacobs, brought and delivered to each prisoner a jacket, pair
of trowsers, a pair of shoes, and a shirt. The jacket and
trowsers were of very coarse blue cloth, much coarser than
that of the English; but it was such a dress as we had been
used to wearing. Mr. Williams then told us that we were to
be clothed altogether by the United States, and these we had
now received were to last us eighteen months. These were
the first we had ever received from the agent; and it is impossible
to describe the great change and life it gave the prisoners:
they all cleaned themselves, and every thing about them,
and laid by their yellow rags.</p>

<p>They began to attract the attention of all about them; the
British officers would now visit them, and were not afraid of
being covered with vermin as before; our appearance was not
loathsome to one another; we were in great spirits now, and
to prevent some thoughtless men from selling their clothing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
the French to wear home, we passed an act that every man
should appear in his dress which he had received from the
United States, to receive his monthly payment, or not receive
it at all.</p>

<p>We now felt a spirit of independence which had before been
smothered in the wretchedness of our situation; we could now
converse with ease, and without that restraint which a mean
and dirty habit will ever give a man in presence of those in a
clean and genteel one; that old, dirty, tawny dress depressed
us with a sense of inferiority; but now we could vindicate
our country’s rights in argument with any visitor; we came
out boldly, and demanded restitution for any injury or fraud that
heretofore had been practised upon us; every man began to
see to it, how he should gain something more, now he was furnished
with utensils, and set himself about something.</p>

<p>On the twentieth, orders arrived for the first draft of
French, and the day after five hundred were taken out and
marched to Plymouth, where they took shipping and went to
France.</p>

<p>A very singular kind of conduct now showed itself in the
British government. Twenty-four Americans, citizens of the
United States, who had been taken under the flag of France
about two years before the war between the United States and
Great Britain, were now among the French prisoners at this
place. They had often applied to the government to be released
as citizens of the United States before the war. They
also, asserting their citizenship, had applied after the war, to
be enrolled on the list of United States prisoners, but had been
refused both their applications. They now expected to be released
with the French prisoners, on account of their always
being considered by government as French prisoners; but the
government would not release them as such, but detained them
in prison. They now, seeing they could not have the privilege
of French prisoners, applied to Mr. Beasley, and claimed
their citizenship in the United States, but received for answer
from him, “that he could not receive them as such!”</p>

<p>These men were citizens of the world sure enough, for they
belonged to no nation in it; they therefore remained unprovided
for by either government. But we could not see them
perish as long as we had any thing which could be divided;
they therefore lived upon our charity the whole time.</p>

<p>On the twenty-fifth, another draft took place as before, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
released one thousand. At this time, all the Swedish subjects,
taken under the flag of the United States, were released and
permitted to go home.</p>

<p>The French, who had been employed in different occupations,
being now released, we applied to government to be allowed
that privilege, each man employed at these different occupations,
such as carpenters, blacksmiths, masons, nurses in the hospital
&amp;c.; and two hundred labourers were paid six pence a day.
In answer to this application, we were told, that after the discharge
of all the French prisoners we should have them allowed
us.</p>

<p>When the French prisoners passed out, they were all called
over by name, and great numbers being dead, which was not
known to the keepers, afforded a fine opportunity for the Americans
to answer, and pass out in the name of the deceased.
Great numbers, who could speak French, obtained their release
in this manner.</p>

<p>At the end of the month, another draft of one thousand took
place, among whom, twenty Americans passed out in the same
manner as before, the deception not being as yet discovered.</p>

<p>At the same time, we received information by letters from
Chatham and Stapleton, that Mr. Williams, and the Jew merchant
had visited them, and supplied them in the manner as
ourselves, and also, that the French prisoners at those places
were released daily. Few died this month, the weather generally
pleasant, but much rain.</p>

<p>Before I leave the events of this month, I cannot forbear
mentioning one very melancholy and striking instance of the
force of disappointment and despair; where hope has painted
glowing scenes of pleasure; the heart sickens and the mind
grows frantic.</p>

<p>On the discharge of the prisoners, every man before he can
be discharged, must return the same complement of bedding
which he had received two years before; he must have
the same number of articles, let them be in ever so worn-out
state; if he do this he can then pass, if not, he cannot pass.</p>

<p>It happened, that one unfortunate man, called for in the last
draft, did not bring forward the articles of bedding: he was refused
a pass, and ordered back to produce them; he ran about in
great confusion and the most terrible anxiety to procure them,
but could not find them; he returned again to pass out, he was
refused; he had been immured and buried within the cold,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
gloomy walls of this prison, eleven tedious and painful years,
he said: he ran and looked, and looked again—he could not
procure them, and he was refused to pass;—then, in the
agonies of despair, he seized a knife and put an end to his sufferings,
by cutting his own throat, in presence of his countrymen
and the keepers!</p>

<p>The spectacle was too horrible to behold without the deepest
regret and sorrow; it was a sight, that all-powerful Juno
might have sent down <i>Iris</i> from heaven, to relieve his struggling
soul from her united limbs. Many, through despair, had
committed suicide before in the French prisons.</p>

<p>June. The weather continued much the same. On the
fifth, another draft of French prisoners was made. At this
time, an order was issued, to discharge from confinement all
French prisoners who had been taken under the flag of the
United States. The Americans, who were ever watchful for
an opportunity to make their escape, took advantage of this
order to obtain their liberty; many came forward and claimed
their birth right in France and its dependencies; being well
versed in the French language, they bore a good examination,
and one hundred and twenty-one were released in the last draft
of French subjects.</p>

<p>By this time all the French from No. 4 were released, and
we had the whole prison to ourselves; but the blacks being
mixed with us were very troublesome.</p>

<p>We having purchased from the French all they had, were
now well furnished with household furniture, such as tables,
dishes, seats, and things to cook in. We now carried on the
business of making straw flats for hats and bonnets, although
not allowed by government; by strict attention, we could make
at this business three pence a day.</p>

<p>On the fifteenth, we received our monthly pay, which never
failed to come about that time.</p>

<p>On the twentieth, the whole of the French prisoners were
discharged except a few sick in the Hospital.</p>

<p>On the 22d, Capt. Shortland gave us information that all the
prisoners in England were to be collected at Stapleton, as the
Transport Board determined on that place for a general depot
for all American prisoners. There were now in England,
three thousand five hundred unparoled prisoners. The same
information was given at Chatham and Plymouth.</p>

<p>We anticipated much advantage in the change of situation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
and began to prepare for the removal, and from the authentic
account we had received from that place, there had not died
but one-fiftieth as many in proportion to their number, as had
died at this depot; the change was therefore much to be desired;
the climate was much more pleasant and healthy, and
the contiguity to the city of Bristol, where every article manufactured
by the prisoners, would find a ready market at a much
higher price than at this place; all articles of provision much
cheaper. But much to our disappointment, on the twenty-fourth,
the late order was countermanded, and Capt. Shortland
ordered to make all things ready for the reception of all the
prisoners in England, as the board had determined on making
this depot the general receptacle for all prisoners in the country,
as they considered it the safest of any in the kingdom, and they
might have added, far more infernal than the Bastile. He also
told the prisoners that he had orders to employ any number of
the prisoners he should think necessary, such as carpenters
and masons, to build a church near the prison, and a number
of laborers to repair the roads; also blacksmiths, coopers,
painters, lamp-lighters, and nurses in the hospital, &amp;c. The
number, he said, would amount to upwards of one hundred. He
then told us under what restrictions we were to work; we were
to be under the eye of a guard all the time, and if any prisoner
attempted to make his escape, that no more Americans would
be employed, and to prevent this, the following rule was adopted;
they were to receive their pay, at the rate of six-pence
per day, every three months, and if any prisoner escaped, the
whole pay was forfeited; this kept every prisoner watchful
over each other, for when one run away, all the others lost their
whole pay and employment; besides, this was the method they
had used with the French.</p>

<p>We found this to be a great benefit to us, for those workmen
who went out of the prison yards, smuggled in all kinds of
prohibited articles, such as rum, candles, oil, and news papers;
and smuggled out all the prohibited articles, manufactured in
the prison. At this trade each man could make four or five
shillings a day.</p>

<p>There were now eleven hundred prisoners, and manufactures
having got to considerable perfection, the receipts of money
brought into the prison each week besides the allowances,
were fifty pounds sterling. Besides this sum of money, many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
prisoners had friends in England, and received from them considerable
sums.</p>

<p>The prisoners now began to live, and got into good spirits.
The latter part of this month 150 workmen were employed at
different branches of mechanical business. At this time prisoners
from Stapleton arrived at this depot; their number at
first was 400, but was now reduced to 350. Seventeen had
enlisted in the British service, eight died, and the remainder
made their escape. On their arrival here, they were committed
to No. 4, which contained upwards of 1400, and was
much crowded. These 350 were in a very bad condition,
many were without shoes, and had travelled most of the distance
in the same condition, for the shoes they had received
from the agent did not last more than three or four weeks.
This was an imposition of the contractor, as the agent afterwards
said he had learned.</p>

<p>On the twentieth of June we were informed, by Capt. Shortland,
that when the other prisoners arrived from Chatham, he
would open the yards on the south side of the enclosure, and
give us all the privileges of the other prisons. These yards
being large, would admit of many amusements which that of
No. 4 would not, such as playing ball, &amp;c.</p>

<p>At this time, viewing our circumstances on all sides, and
seeing no hope of exchange or peace, we formed a design to
make our escape; our plan was, that immediately after our
removal to the other prisons, to dig a hole two hundred and
eighty feet long, all the way under ground; this would reach
from the prison beyond the outer wall. The success of this
design will be mentioned hereafter. On the same day we received
London papers, containing an account of the capture of
the United States frigate Essex, by the frigate Phebe and sloop-of-war
Cherub. The London editor said that the Essex was
equal in size to a seventy-four. Had he said her defence was
equal to a seventy-four, Capt. Hillyar would have agreed with
him. The garrison was again renewed with a new regiment,
and the old one removed. This regiment was very much embittered
against the government; their term of five years, for
which they had enlisted, having expired, the government refused
to discharge them.</p>

<p>At this time the government was giving great encouragement
to soldiers to enlist to fight against the United States;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
this regiment was offered every inducement to join; they
therefore made it their business to make particular inquiry of
the prisoners what was the manner of our warfare, and the
dispositions of the American soldiers. I found they were very
ignorant in these things, and easily deterred from their enlisting.
I composed a song, and distributed it among them, after
which not a man ever enlisted or offered to. This very much
enraged the soldier-officers of the garrison, who issued orders
that if any sentry was found conversing with a prisoner, he
should be punished; but it was impossible to stop it, the soldiers
were equally desirous as the prisoners to converse.</p>

<p>The fourth of July was not far distant, and we began to
make preparations to celebrate the day a second time since our
confinement. We obtained permission from the keeper to
purchase two hogsheads of porter; we likewise had got a
number of gallons of rum unbeknown to the keeper.</p>

<p>We also provided ourselves with American colors, and invited
all the soldier-officers, clerks of the prison, and soldiers,
to attend and hear an oration that would be delivered on the
fourth, which was the anniversary of American Independence.
The prisoners were in high spirits, expecting to enjoy themselves
much better than they had done on the preceding one,
when they were half naked.</p>

<p>In the month of June we had but few deaths, and the prisoners
generally healthy; we had rain, and many showers.</p>

<p>On the first of July we received letters from Chatham, informing
us that they were much concerned at a late order,
which was shortly to remove them to this depot; the same
letter informed us that the prisoners on board the Crowned
Prince had been confined three days without victuals or drink;
the reason why is yet untold.</p>

<p>On the second of the month the crew of the Argus received
another payment of several pounds each man, through the
hands of the late purser to that vessel; this came very timely
to us in the celebration of American Independence.</p>

<p>By letters from Plymouth, this day, we were informed the
reason of the prisoners being confined below deck on board
the Crowned Prince.</p>

<p>It happened that the boats’ crew of that ship had been on
shore and stole a sheep from a farmer, and the commander
had had his table served with the best pieces; the farmer getting
information where the sheep had gone, came and demanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
reparation for his sheep; the commander, to screen
the boats’ crew, paid the farmer the price of the sheep.</p>

<p>The story of the sheep was soon known to the prisoners,
who, having a dislike to the commander, one morning, as he
was going on shore with his wife, and at the moment he was
entering the boat, they all as one agreed to cry <i>blar</i>; he understood
the meaning the very instant the sound struck his ear,
and turning back, he ordered the prisoners all below, and to
be kept there three days without victuals or drink.</p>

<p>On the evening of the third, an event happened at Dartmoor,
which ended in a very serious manner. A dispute
arose between two of the prisoners late belonging to the United
States’ brig Argus, by the names of Thomas Hill and James
Henry; the quarrel growing quite warm, and not being ended
that night, they agreed to fight next morning; accordingly,
next morning, about nine o’clock, they commenced the battle
in prison No. 4, and by an unfortunate blow from Hill, Henry
was killed on the spot; a jury of inquest was called next morning
and held over the body of the deceased, and after hearing
the evidence, the jury brought in a verdict of manslaughter, (or
a killing not wholly without fault, but without malice.)
Thomas Hill was removed and confined in the county prison
at Exeter, there to await his trial at the August assizes then
next ensuing.</p>

<p>The fourth of July now having arrived, and all things in
great preparation, we displayed our flag in the yard, with the
following inscription upon it in large capitals, “<i>All Canada or
Dartmoor prison for life</i>.” This pleased the soldiers, but irritated
the officers, who, discovering our firm resolution to defend
the flag, and not having but part of a regiment in the garrison,
and they friendly toward us, thought best to be quite silent,
and let us proceed our own way; for if they attempted to deprive
us of the flag, we might rush on the guard, who would
make but a faint resistance, or join us, and all the prisoners
might make an easy escape. But the prisoners did not wish
to make the attempt, for they knew a reinforcement could
easily be raised, and make a vigorous pursuit, and were
therefore willing to wait some more favorable opportunity. At
eleven o’clock all the prisoners assembled in the yard. The
British officers belonging to the garrison, colonels, majors,
captains, clerks, turnkeys, and a great number of soldiers, assembled
on the walls to hear an oration composed by a Yankee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
sailor, upon the circumstances of the present times. An empty
cask was placed in such a situation, as all the strangers on the
walls could hear distinctly.</p>

<p>The orator of the day then mounted the cask, and all the
spectators keeping a profound silence, began his oration, which
we shall give our readers verbatim, as it was delivered by the
sailor.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>Countrymen and fellow-citizens</i>:<br>
</p>

<p>This day we dedicate as the birth-day of freedom, it being
the fourth of July—the day that our fathers declared themselves
free and independent from the tyrannical laws of this
country. After many years hard struggle, and the loss of
many of our fathers and friends, America was acknowledged
by all civilized nations, a free and independent government.</p>

<p>For many years our fathers, and we, their offspring, remained
in the most perfect state of peace and tranquility, and
reaped every blessing that grows on the soil of liberty; England,
ever envying us the honor our fathers acquired by their
valor in arms, when they declared that themselves and their
sons should no longer wear the yoke of tyranny. Since that
time, England has used every intrigue to deprive us of the
greatest of blessings. First, contrary to the laws of civilized
nations, she has dragged you from your homes, from your
wives, your families and friends, into her infernal bulwarks—her
ships of war; there, after suffering every degradation, from
the terror of the lash, she has sent you to the most horrid prison
in compensation for your long and faithful services. England,
envying the happiness our countrymen enjoyed under so
mild a government, the reverse of her own tyrannical laws,
exerted every art to destroy their tranquility, by offering insults
to the United States ships at various times, impressing and
murdering our brother seamen, within the jurisdiction of our
own waters, and within sight of our capitol. Our country
was passive, and wishing to remain at peace with all nations,
bore these insults with a fortitude becoming a great and wise
people, and was in hope that, at some future day, England
would redress those injuries in a fair and honorable way. But,
contrary to every expectation for years before the war, she
grew more bold, and showed a disposition to add injury to insult,
by issuing orders to make prizes of all American vessels
not bound to her own ports or those of her allies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>All nations stood amazed to see our country insulted, our
seamen impressed and murdered within our own waters; our
commerce confined and completely destroyed, contrary to the
laws of neutrality. All this was done by England, and she
unprovoked. Then, fellow-citizens, the results of all these depredations
must be a formal declaration of war, which could no
longer be delayed. Our country then, prudently and wisely,
mustered all their forces, both by sea and land; England stood
ready for combat fully prepared, and with the fullest assurance
of a speedy victory; but, alas! for England; within a few
weeks after the declaration of war, the United States frigate
Constitution, commanded by Captain Isaac Hull, fell in with
His Majesty’s ship Guerriere, and then retaliated for one insult
by sending her to the bottom. Great was the astonishment of
England.</p>

<p>Shortly after, the U. S. ship Wasp fell in with His Majesty’s
ship Frolic, of far superior force, and after a second
retaliation, she acknowledged her country’s wrongs by striking
her colors to the gallant Jones.</p>

<p>The officers and seamen of our infant navy now felt the
ardor of our forefathers.</p>

<p>Decatur, in the frigate United States, fell in with a vessel
of equal force, the Macedonian, the pride of the British navy;
and, after displaying the courage of injured Americans, he
took and brought her into port.</p>

<p>The Constitution shortly after took her station alongside
of the Java, a frigate completely fitted and manned with a
superior number of seamen; and again did the god of battle
decide in favor of the injured Americans, and sent the Java to
the bottom. The tidings had scarcely reached the American
shore, when another laurel was added to our infant navy; the
United States ship Hornet engaged His Majesty’s ship Peacock,
of equal force; and Capt. Lawrence, unwilling to make
any distinction between her and the Java, sent her to the bottom,
too.</p>

<p>This intelligence had scarcely reached the shores of
liberty, when victories were proclaimed from all directions.</p>

<p>The British, feeling their pride wounded by the great exploits
of our undaunted seamen, fitted out the Boxer, with the
fullest assurance of recovering her lost honor, and were confident
of taking our brig Enterprise, of much inferior force.
But Divine Providence, ever extending the hand of assistance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
to the injured, decided the contest in favor of our insulted
country; and the Boxer was captured and brought safe into
port, in the United States.</p>

<p>Our next laurel was reaped on Lake Erie, by Commodore
Perry. He bravely captured all the naval force on that lake,
to the amazement of all surrounding nations, and the disgrace
of the British flag.</p>

<p>Commodore Chauncey, at the same time, had a complete
ascendency over the whole British force on Lake Ontario;
while Commodore Rodgers is traversing the ocean in every
direction, and destroying British property to an immense value.
The United States ship Essex is complete master of all the
South Seas, in defiance of all the boasted superiority of the
British. The United States ship Congress is cruising on the
coast of Brazil, and completely intercepting the trade of Great
Britain to all Spanish South America, and defying any thing
of equal size.</p>

<p>And now, fellow-citizens, this country, what has she done?
She has long boasted of her honor and her bravery; and she
has issued orders to her frigates, never to engage an American
frigate unless under cover of a ship of the line. She has likewise
endeavored to rouse the anger of the savage tribes in the
wilderness of Canada, to murder and scalp your brethren in
arms, in that country. But Divine Providence, still assisting
your injured country, turned the ferocity of the savages against
those who moved them to anger, and their vengeance recoiled
on the hand that attempted to use it. And you, fellow-citizens,
although prisoners of war, feel the benefit of belonging to so
great and wise a nation. Have the United States not assisted
us in our unhappy situation, and much meliorated our sufferings,
though illy able while carrying on so expensive a
war?</p>

<p>And now, fellow-citizens, I conjure you to be patient, and
consider your country to be using her utmost endeavor to
bring about an honorable and speedy peace. In a state of war,
many stories are circulated in this country favorable to her
success in arms, which have no foundation; and this is done
to encourage and inspire the soldiery to enlist in her wars; and
perhaps, fellow-citizens, many of you may honestly believe the
reports, but let them not make you despair of your country.
No, depend upon it, she cannot be conquered. England may
get momentary possession of one small city, or perhaps ten,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
but America is not conquered till every man is either taken
prisoner or killed.</p>

<p>The success of our naval arms is a sufficient proof, and
our country is now in triumph at her great naval success.
Have we not this moment, as it were, heard of another brilliant
achievement upon the ocean? The United States ship Peacock,
on her first cruise after she left the stocks, captured and
brought into port His Majesty’s ship L’Epervier, of equal
size, with immense sums of silver and much treasure on
board?</p>

<p>From the success of American arms, which have already
astonished our enemies, we have nothing to fear; and we have
the greatest reason to believe that the American cause is big
with the most wonderful achievements; that the exploits of
our countrymen in arms, in the present contest, will astonish
all nations, and be recorded on the pages of history, and remain
in the choicest archives of posterity, with equal glory to those
of Marathon and Thermopylæ.</p>

<p>Fellow-prisoners, let us then be resigned to our present
unhappy condition; and through the great exertion of our
country, and the assistance of Divine Providence, who disposes
of events and governs futurity, we may hope once more to revisit
our native country in an honorable peace, and live happy
and free.</p>
</div>

<p>After the oration was delivered, the officers that were on the
walls entered the prison yard, and expressed the greatest surprise
that we should entertain a hope that the United States
would be successful in a war with Great Britain, when she
was at peace with all other nations. But for <i>consolation</i> to us
in our present condition, we might rest fully assured that we
should be released in a very short time by a peace, which
would be brought about by their conquering the United States,
and reducing them to colonies again; and such a change,
which must shortly take place, they said must be imputed entirely
to the bad management of our President and Congress:
we have now conquered France, and America must be conquered
next. We found them ignorant of the strength and resources
of the American people; we gave them a particular
account of the situation of America, her means of defence, and
the spirit and determination of the people; the great superiority
of gunnery which the American seamen possessed over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
those of Great Britain; the truth of which was shown in the
actions of the Guerriere, Frolic, Java, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>They left the yard much chagrined at these facts, which
they could not deny; and remarking that they were surprised
to find sailors so well acquainted with the politics of both
countries, but that they believed they must be most of them
Englishmen born, and that it was a very great pity His Majesty
should be deprived of so many valuable seamen.</p>

<p>At two o’clock we sat down to our fourth of July dinner,
which was composed of soup and beef, the best we could prepare.
We gathered in parties, with the greatest animation,
conversing of our President and Congress, for whom we sailors
have the greatest respect; and Mr. Madison, particularly, is a
great favorite of sailors. After dinner we had a song, which
was composed for the occasion.</p>

<p>The day was passed in the greatest harmony; no quarrel or
strife occurred to mar its pleasure. The next day every man
resumed his occupation, and seemed to enjoy a negative happiness,
which arose from a freedom from absolute pain.</p>

<p>On the eighth of this month, a friend of mine, for whom I
had much respect, died; and at his burial I took occasion to
survey the vast tenements of the dead, and consider, within
myself, what innumerable multitudes of people lay confused
together on this moor; how friends and enemies, officers and
soldiers, the brave and the coward, collected from all quarters
of the globe, of all nations, and of all colors, lay undistinguished
in one common mass of matter; and not a stone to name one
tenant of the tomb.</p>

<p>After having surveyed this great magazine of mortality as it
were, in the lump, out of respect to my friend, I searched about
and obtained a very slaty stone, on which I inscribed the following
words:</p>

<p class="center">
Here lies the body of<br>
<br>
JAMES HART,<br>
<br>
A native of the United States of<br>
<br>
America,<br>
<br>
<i>Who departed this life July 8th, 1814</i>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>Under which was the following epitaph:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Your country mourns your hapless fate;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So mourn we prisoners all;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You’ve paid the debt we all must pay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each sailor, great and small.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Your body on this barren moor,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your soul in Heaven doth rest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where Yankee sailors, one and all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hereafter will be blest.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The agent permitted us to put this stone up, and of the many
thousands that lay indiscriminately mingled together upon this
moor, this stone recorded the only syllable of the dead buried
here. The life of these men is finely described in Holy Writ
by the path of an arrow, which is immediately closed up and
lost.</p>

<p>We received our monthly pay as usual, and nothing remarkable
occurred during the remainder of the month; few
persons arrived, but we had expectation of a great number.
The weather was rainy and cold; the prisoners generally
healthy; few died, but the prison was very much crowded,
there being 1,500 in No. 4.</p>

<p>At the commencement of August, a draft of prisoners arrived,
who had been recently captured on the coast of Europe,
among whom were four men lately belonging to the private
armed schooner Surprise, of Baltimore; these four men, on their
first arrival at this depot, were put into close confinement in the
cachot, there to remain on two-thirds allowance, without hammock
or bed, sleeping on the stone floor, during their whole
imprisonment. When the cause of their confinement was
known, it seems it had grown out of the following circumstances:</p>

<p>The Surprise was cruising in the channel of England, and
fell in with, and captured, a schooner, and put on board her
these four men, to take charge of the prize.</p>

<p>Shortly after, the prize was recaptured by an English frigate,
and, after taking possession of her, found stowed away in
the round-house (which is a few feet above the deck) a cask of
powder, which contained but a few pounds at most, and on
examination they found part of a match and a candle; the captain
of the frigate, being suspicious of these four men’s having
an intention to blow the vessel up, took them and committed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
them to close confinement until he arrived in England; he then
reported them to the Board of Transport, and delivered them
into their custody, and they, from these suspicious circumstances,
sentenced them to the punishment above mentioned.
Whether the crime, had it been well proved, would warrant
so rigorous a punishment, is not the subject of investigation;
they had the power to treat them as they pleased, nor had the
sufferers any redress, for, <i>inter armis lages silent</i>, “the laws
are silent amid arms.”</p>

<p>On the arrival of these prisoners, Capt. Shortland opened the
south yard of the enclosure, and gave all the officers liberty to
go into No. 6. A few days after, a <i>habeas corpus ad testificandum</i>
was awarded to bring forward six prisoners, to appear
and give evidence in the cause of Thomas Hill, then depending
at the next Exeter assizes, who was charged with manslaughter
for killing James Henry on the third of July. The
termination of the trial, I shall give in a subsequent page.</p>

<p>The prisoners having no expectation or hope of exchange,
or a peace, now set about contriving a method of escape, something
of which we hinted at in a preceding page. The plan
was to dig out of prison No. 6. The plan was made known
to the prisoners in No. 4, who were expecting to be removed
into No. 6 in a few days, when they would have access to
Nos. 5, 6, and 7, which were contained in one yard. To
have the plan circulated with the greatest secrecy that would
obtain the opinion of all the prisoners, without the suspicion of
the guards or officers, it was thought best to have it done in
poetry, and accordingly it was done in that manner. This attracted
the attention of the prisoners, and we soon found the
intention of each man to favor the plan.</p>

<p>On the fifteenth of August, the six men whom we mentioned
in the preceding page, were taken to Exeter, returned, and
with them Thomas Hill, who was acquitted by the jury, and
he remanded to Dartmoor as a prisoner of war.</p>

<p>The same day arrived a large draft of prisoners, who had
been sent from Halifax prison on board the transport ship Bensen.
These persons, on their passage, attempted to rise and
take the ship, in which attempt a sharp contest ensued, and the
struggle was for some time doubtful, but the American prisoners
were overpowered, and afterwards treated with the
greatest severity and cruelty. In the engagement several on
both sides were severely wounded, but none killed or mortally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
wounded. Some of the prisoners were taken out and put on
board the ship Commodore, and the remainder confined in the
coal-hole, and kept on bread and water for several days.</p>

<p>These prisoners were put into No. 6, which now made
about eight hundred in that prison, and about twelve hundred
in No. 4, who were not yet removed.</p>

<p>We finding our number increasing daily, and no prospect of
peace or exchange, now determined to put in execution our
projected plan of escape; every prisoner being willing, and
not a dissenting voice among the whole, we mustered a number
of bibles in each prison, and began to solemnly swear every
man to keep secret every transaction he should see or know of
concerning the operation then about to be begun; when a man
was sworn, he was strictly cautioned and charged not to make
known, by word or sign, in any way whatever, anything
which might lead to a discovery of their design, on pain of immediate
death in a private and secret manner, which would
most assuredly take place without the knowledge of the
keepers.</p>

<p>After they were all sworn, and the fixed determination
of hanging the first informer, a number of confidential persons
were appointed as spies, to watch the conduct of others. We
also appointed other trusty men to watch the movements of the
turnkeys and sentries, and see that the prisoners held no conversation
with either of them. We then divided ourselves into
parties to work, and who were alternately to dig and relieve
each other.</p>

<p>After taking a correct survey of the ground, measuring and
making it out, and taking the course, on the twentieth we made
a beginning in both prisons, and dug directly down. In this
perpendicular direction we must sink our work twenty feet,
which would come on a horizontal plane with the road.
On this horizontal plane we must then pursue the work,
in an eastern direction, two hundred and fifty feet, which
distance would carry us beyond the outer wall and under
all the foundations which extended below the surface of the
earth about six feet; if this work were performed we should
then have a passage into the road. The digging could be carried
on with very little difficulty: but the great obstacle before
us was to convey away the dirt, and this, on a little consideration,
seemed to vanish when we considered the stream of water
in the yard, which passed under the prison at the rate of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
four miles an hour; into this stream we threw great quantities
of fine dirt, which passed off. We, as another means to
get clear of the dirt, obtained permission to bring into the
prison a large quantity of lime, under the pretence of white-washing
the walls of the prison.</p>

<p>These walls were made of large rough stone, and every
night we made of the dirt a sort of morter, and plastered on
the walls, and then white-washed it over.</p>

<p>No. 5 prison containing no prisoners, and not being visited
by the keepers, we thought best to begin a similar operation in
that prison, as we could pass and repass into it unknown to
the keepers. In this we commenced digging in the day-time,
and found a hollow place under the prison to stow the dirt
away.</p>

<p>In these three different places we made our attacks, and
very rightly supposing, that if one should be discovered, that
we should still have another, which we could proceed in without
suspicion; we were apprehensive that the run of water,
which passed through an iron grating at the outlet, might get
stopped with the dirt, and lead to a discovery. We hastened
on the work, every man as busy as a bee, and flushed with the
hope and full belief that we should shortly make our escape.</p>

<p>At the close of the month, we had dug toward the wall in a
horizontal direction forty feet, without the least suspicion. As
we entered so far under ground we found a want of fresh air,
and to remedy this, we contrived a lamp to keep burning in
the hole, that would expel all the axotic gas, or dead air, and
bring in a constant supply of fresh.</p>

<p>I must digress for a moment, to give an account of some
events which took place during this operation.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile a number of prisoners arrived; some from
Chatham, some from the West Indies, and from other places.
These, as soon as they arrived, were made acquainted with our
design and operations, and sworn and charged as the others had
been. Among these prisoners was the crew of the United States
brig Frolic. These prisoners were destitute of clothing, and in
a very bad state of health, which was occasioned by being so
very closely confined during the passage, and their allowance
so very short. During the month we had great quantities of
rain, which was very favorable to our operations. The prisoners
were now more healthy than they had been before since
our confinement. Those who had been sick for some time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
died. Those who had been here a long time had become used
to the hardships, but new comers were sickly.</p>

<p>On the last day of August, our subterraneous passage was
sixty feet from No. 5, and about the same from No. 6, and No.
4 nearly equal. The dirt being very loose, and but few stones
to obstruct our way, our passage seemed short, and promised
success.</p>

<p>September having commenced, and no suspicion or discovery
as yet made, although the prisons were searched every day by
the keepers; but the holes being very small, and so nicely
closed every day, that it would require the minutest search to
discover the place; but the hole was larger under ground, and
would admit four men to work abreast.</p>

<p>But, to our great mortification, on the second, Capt. Shortland
entered the prison with the guards, and went directly towards
the hole, and as he passed, he informed us that he knew of our
operations in No. 5, but his informer had not told him correctly,
for after a long search, they could not discover the hole.</p>

<p>It was then suggested by his attendants to sound the prison;
they then began with crow-bars to sound, and after having
made the minutest examination, by accident found the entrance,
to the great mortification of every man.</p>

<p>They undertook to enter the hole, but after entering a few
feet, their lights went out, and they could not keep them burning;
and being unacquainted with the materials, and method
used by us to light the hole and expel the dead air, could not
penetrate to the extent, nor did they ever enter near all the
distance.</p>

<p>They were no less astonished to conceive what had become
of the dirt taken from the passage, and it ever remained a
great mystery to them.</p>

<p>Every man was strictly cautioned, should any discovery take
place, not to give any account whatever of the means they
had made use of to light the hole, or how they had disposed of
the dirt; and when they were strictly examined by the officers,
they gave no other answer, than that each man eat his proportion,
to make up his scant allowance.</p>

<p>To prevent any further operation of this kind, Capt. Shortland
had every prisoner removed from the yard which encloses
No. 5, 6, and 7, into the enclosure on the north side, which
contained No. 1, 2, and 3; but having no suspicions of any
attempts to escape in No. 4, they let the prisoners there remain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>After the prisoners were removed from the other two prisons,
they filled the entrance of the hole up with stone: they supposed
these were not eatable.</p>

<p>We remained in No. 2 till the eighth, when we were again
removed to the south side, on account of prison No. 2 being
out of repair. This gave us fresh hopes. As the noise had
not yet entirely got silent, we thought best to stop all operations
in No. 4 for the present.</p>

<p>In the mean while, our court of judicature was sitting, and
several persons were arraigned at the bar, and charged with
having given information of our design to escape; all the evidence
against them was produced, but the crime being of a
capital nature by our laws, required positive and direct evidence,
which the court considered had not been produced; and
although very strong circumstantial evidence had been given,
yet they considered that such evidence ought never to take a
man’s life, which must have been the case had any one been
found guilty.</p>

<p>We afterwards believed it must have been accidental; that
some person had spoken too loud, or in an unguarded manner
in the presence of the turnkeys; for we found no discovery
had been made of the operations in No. 4 or 5, although Capt.
Shortland had declared himself to be acquainted with them in
No. 5.</p>

<p>After the bustle of the discovery had a little blown over,
and the officers and keepers had ridiculed the futile idea of our
making our escape, by saying they had guards and spies in all
directions; we then gave orders to the blacks in No. 4 to proceed
on with their work. At this time, the 10th, a draft of
prisoners arrived from Chatham; these were mostly men delivered
up from ships of war in England, and some few were
sent from the West Indies, Bermuda, and New Providence.—This
draft increased the number of prisoners at this depot to
three thousand five hundred in all.</p>

<p>When these men arrived, we were under great apprehensions
that they would be ordered into No. 5, and in the hurry and
bustle of entering, before they were cautioned, might lead to
a discovery of the work in that prison; but happily, they
were ordered into No. 7, and all the white prisoners from No.
4 ordered in with them; and all the blacks were now to be kept
by themselves.</p>

<p>They were directed to proceed as we mentioned before, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
to report progress every evening. As the hole in No. 6 was
farthest advanced, we formed a communication to let each
other know their progress each day, that all the holes might
proceed with equal progress, and come out at the same time.</p>

<p>With this arrangement we proceeded on, and on the 12th,
in No. 6, we dug down, and the next day had gone quite round
the stones which were thrown in to fill up the entrance of the
hole, and came out into the former passage: this was done in
the night, and in the day time we carried on the work in No.
5, disposing of the dirt as before.</p>

<p>The work went on with the greatest care, secrecy and
success, and every man was animated with the liveliest
hope of soon gaining his liberty, till each hole had come within
thirty-five or forty feet of the intended place of coming out.</p>

<p>We could always ascertain the distance we were from the
top of the ground by measuring with our line and rule, and
had concluded to work that distance in one week: every man
was now provided with a dagger, made by prisoners who
worked at black-smithing.</p>

<p>When the work was complete, we were to make our move
some dark stormy night at the hour of ten, which would give
every man who wished, an opportunity to reach Torbay, about
ten miles distant, at which place lay a large number of unarmed
vessels, fishing boats and other small craft; we could reach
this place a little after midnight, and then proceed as fast as
possible for France; on leaving the outlet of the passage every
man was to separate and take care of himself. When we
were once out, we had determined to reach France or sell our
lives at the dearest rate; for, by this time, life was of little
consequence to us, when we compared it to the miseries we
must suffer, if we should be brought back, and therefore we
were determined to hazard it at all events.</p>

<p>But I hasten from our future resolutions to relieve the reader
from his anxiety, by showing the event.</p>

<p>At this moment, when every man was well pleased with the
prospect, how was his just indignation raised, and his fierce
anger kindled!—a man by the name of <a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>Bagley, another Sinon,
walked out in the open day, before all the prisoners then in the
yard, went up to the turnkeys and marched off with them to
the keeper’s house, gave him information of all the operations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>and designs, and we never saw him after; for could we have
catched him, we should scarcely have tried him, but should
have torn him in atoms before the life could have time to leave
his traitorous body.</p>

<p>This Judas received the price of his iniquity from the Transport
Board, and got a passport to go where he pleased, and the
public’s humble servant put into the cachot;—but I can tell
him, should this work ever reach his infamous hand, that it is
the sincere wish of every prisoner, that he may fall, and like
that other Judas, his bowels may gush out.</p>

<p>The prisoners were then immediately removed to the north
side of the enclosure, and confined to No. 1 and 3; and to repair
the damages which had been done to the prisons, Capt.
Shortland put every man on two thirds allowance, and took the
other third to pay expenses of repair; this he did for ten
days successively; if we had eaten the dirt up, we had to
starve it back again.</p>

<p>Our hopes were all blown up to the moon, and we left
to despair; we had no prospect by which we could hope to be
relieved, but every thing seemed to threaten us with imprisonment
for life. We again resigned ourselves to our situation,
and placed all our hopes of life and liberty on that Almighty
arm, which had brought us to these sufferings by His Divine
pleasure. Every man with reluctance now returns to his usual
occupation, hoping to gain a few articles of clothing, which
he stood in need of. The shoes furnished by Mr. Beasley,
which were the poorest that could be made in England, were
now worn out, and we needed others.</p>

<p>It was reported among the prisoners, that an exchange was
about to take place; but as we had no account to that effect
from Mr. Beasley, we could place no dependence on it; the
only hope we had was bribing the guards, and that of peace.</p>

<p>By letters from Plymouth, we had information that an action
had been fought between the Essex, Capt. Porter, and the
British frigate Phebe, Capt. Hillyar, and a sloop of war. The
action was long and severe, and much blood spilt on both sides;
and although the Essex was taken, the honour of the day belonged
to the Americans. She fought under every disadvantage,
and gallantly stood the fire of both the enemy’s vessels,
and bore hard for a victory, till chance decided against her.
The magnanimity of the officers and crew commands the noblest
sentiments of respect from every American; they deserved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
no common meed of praise; I therefore undertook to
celebrate their valorous deeds in verse.</p>

<p>A large draft of prisoners, from Chatham, arrived at this
place the latter end of this month; among them were great
numbers of men who had been detained on board His Majesty’s
ships from eight to twelve years, and one who had been detained
eighteen years. The greatest part of this draft were
men who had been delivered up from the navy; they were collected
at Chatham, and brought round by water to Plymouth,
landed, and then ordered to prepare to march for Dartmoor
prison, the sufferings of which they had long been acquainted
with, by report; but previous to their departure, they, anticipating
their treatment there, prepared the following motto, in
capitals, and fixed it to the fore part of their hats: “<i>British
gratitude for past services</i>.” With this on their hats, they
marched the distance of eighteen miles. During the march,
the officers tried every means to persuade them to take it off,
but they absolutely refused, saying it was truth, and, as prisoners
of war, they had a just cause to complain of the treatment
and ingratitude of a government which they had so long
served. They insisted that it was cruelty to make them prisoners,
after they had served so many years as good and faithful
servants; and it was much more ungrateful now to send
them to the worst prison in England, as a compensation for
their long and faithful services.</p>

<p>The garrison was now reinforced by a large number of soldiers,
and the prisoners separated; the whites in the north and
south wing, occupying two prisons in each yard, and the blacks
one in the centre. The prisoners were not permitted to have intercourse
with one another from the different prisons, except
on Sundays.</p>

<p>The number being now very large, it was feared they would
rise, and take possession of the guard-house, and then make
their escape. They had some ground to fear the event might
take place, for the prisoners did not consider these walls, nor
the soldiers, any very great obstacle in the accomplishment of
such an undertaking, had it been their design. But they knew
very well the consequence of doing this; although, on the first
<i>sortie</i>, the officers, soldiers and guards, must fall into their
power, yet as the prisoners must all march in a body to keep
them under, the alarm would spread over all England, and the
militia be raised upon them, before they would be able to reach
the sea-coast and take shipping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>Capt. Shortland was in daily fear of such an attack, for
there was scarce a day but some dispute or strife took place
between the turnkeys or guards and the prisoners, and kept a
continual alarm. The prisoners would not hear any abusive
language against the President of the United States; and on
the first disrespectful word from a sentry, stationed singly in
the yard, they would knock him down, and he could get no
relief till they were willing to release him, for the prisoners
immediately surrounded him by hundreds; and the garrison
declared that they had more trouble with four thousand Americans
than they should have with twenty thousand Frenchmen.</p>

<p>On the last day of this month, another draft arrived, among
whom were the crew of the United States brig Rattlesnake and
some others, sent from Halifax.</p>

<p>The prisoners became sickly again, and upwards of one hundred
in the hospital; but they had much better attendance than
before, having now a new surgeon, Dr. Magrath, to superintend
that department; he was a humane, skilful and attentive
man, and a friend to the sick and distressed prisoner. I know
of nothing more agreeable to the human feelings than the presence
of a friend by our sick-bed; and this man administered
more of the medicine of life by the sympathetic emotions of his
heart than all the anodynes in the apothecary’s shop.</p>

<p>We had much rain and stormy weather during the month of
September. One tedious month had now passed by, and
another lay in hopeless prospect before us; but our hopes
were a little revived on the second of October by a letter which
we received from Mr. Beasley, informing us that a partial exchange
would take place between the two countries. This exchange
would extend to none but those taken in the United
States vessels; this letter was to inform the crew of the Argus
more particularly, as they were the oldest prisoners taken in
the United States service. The same letter gave general information
that there was great prospects of a speedy peace between
the two belligerants.</p>

<p><i>Several persons made their escape by bribing the sentries after
this news</i>, and passing out in the night, with a soldier’s coat
and cap on, under his protection. But this method was discovered
and stopped, and eight only were able to make their
escape by it.</p>

<p>We received the account of the United States ship Wasp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
sinking the Reindeer and Avon. The particulars seemed too
galling to their feelings to publish. After reading the account
in the London paper, I composed a dirge, and put it up on the
front of the prison, in full sight of all the soldier-officers and
guards, as a tribute of respect to departed worthies of His Majesty’s
navy.</p>

<p>Almost every draft of prisoners brought intelligence of new
victories of the Americans by sea, and every British paper was
filled with complaints of American privateers destroying British
property in their own waters, and in sight of their cities.
The prisoners, being animated with the success of the arms of
their country, could not forbear expressing their joy in some
pleasant feat. The following anecdote has something of the
features of the attack of Don Quixotte on the wind-mill. The
prisoners, the night after the news of the Wasp, took a jacket
at twelve at night, lowered it down towards the ground along
the rope of the prison; the soldiers saw it, and concluded it
must be a man sliding down the rope to make his escape; the
alarm was given, and Capt. Shortland and all the soldier-officers
at the head of the picket, entered, and hailed the man on the
rope, but no answer; they then drew themselves up in martial
array, and every man sat his teeth and screwed his courage up
to the sticking place, ready for battle; Capt. Shortland, an experienced
officer, gave orders to fire, and instantly a volley of
musketry was poured in upon the enemy, and down came the
jacket; they rushed in upon it, and, to their astonishment, they
had conquered a jacket.</p>

<p>The keepers who had been so insolent the day before, by
wishing Mr. Madison in the prison, now showed great resentment,
and gave themselves many airs upon the occasion. The
soldiers discovered a candle burning in the prison, and called
aloud, “put out that candle;” but the order not being instantly
obeyed, they discharged a volley through the window; but a
divine interposition of goodness seemed to direct the balls, for
every one lodged in some part of the hammocks, which almost
formed a solid column, and not a single man hurt or touched,
though asleep in the hammocks. The next morning I thought
the battle with the jacket and the attack on the sleeping prisoners
deserved to be celebrated in some signal way, and sung
like the deeds of the gallant Quixotte.</p>

<p>It had been remarked by the prisoners that, about the time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
of some reverse of the arms of the enemy, the keepers treated
them with much greater severity, and seemed to wish to wreak
their vengeance in retaliation on the prisoners.</p>

<p>On the eighteenth, orders, together with a list of names, came
to discharge sixty-two of the crew of the late United States
brig Frolic, who had been exchanged, and were to repair immediately
to Dartmouth, thirty miles from the depot, to go on
board the cartel Janey, then lying at that place with the greater
part of her number, which consisted of prisoners late belonging
to the United States navy and army.</p>

<p>Those sixty-two of the Frolic were obliged to carry the baggage
themselves or leave it behind, for they were allowed no
means to transport it. Twelve miles of the distance is water
carriage; the other eighteen is land—this distance they had to
march on foot; they received a shilling each man, and one
day’s provision, at the commencement of the journey.</p>

<p>By letters from Plymouth, we received intelligence that
another cartel, the St. Philip, was preparing to take on board
part of her complement at that place, then to proceed to Dartmouth,
and receive the crew of the late United States brig Argus,
and her officers, and non-combatants from Ashburton. The
same letters informed us that all the prisoners in England, then
nearly five thousand, would shortly be removed to this prison;
and, accordingly, at the latter end of this month they all were
removed to this depot, and made, with some few lately from
sea, five thousand and twenty. They were badly prepared to
stand the inclemency of the approaching season; they
were all miserably clothed, and the shoes they had received
from Mr. Beasley lasted but a few weeks, and they were now
quite destitute and very sickly, and the weather cold and stormy
for several days together. On the third we received a letter
from Mr. Beasley, informing us that his clerk, Mr. Williams,
was on his way from London to this place with clothing, which
he would distribute among the prisoners captured since the
middle of last May, and to those captured before that date he
would deliver one shirt and one pair of shoes and stockings,
which should be their supply for nine months. The old prisoners
stated their situation to Mr. Beasley, by letter, at the
same date, and informed him that they were in need of clothing;
that what they received in May was worn out, also their
shoes, and that they were not supplied with sufficient bedding
to make them any way comfortable through the approaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
winter, especially as they were sickly, and had the small-pox
in the prison, and that they should not be able to endure the
hardships of their condition, though their two and a half pence
a day was some relief; yet as all the workmen were turned
into prison, and not permitted to go out any more on account
of one man, whom we believe to be Capt. Swain, of New Bedford,
Massachusetts, taking a very sudden move and leaving the
whole establishment without giving notice; this left them unprovided
with sufficient means to take care of themselves.</p>

<p>Now the surly blasts of chill November had made all surrounding
nature wear the sad aspect of decay, and the barefooted
prisoner stood shivering by the walls, in the pale and
feeble ray of a winter sun, when Mr. Williams arrived with
the clothing, as was expected, and on the third saw the crew
of the Argus take their departure from this prison, to go on
board the St. Philip, then lying at Dartmouth, bound for the
United States. The draft of this crew consisted of one hundred,
which was all that was taken from this place; she had
previously taken in her complement, except this number, at
Chatham. Shortly after her sailing from Dartmouth she was
so unfortunate as to spring her mast, and obliged to return into
port.</p>

<p>At this time the Phebe and the late United States frigate Essex
arrived in England. The editors who published the arrival
of these two ships, made no remark or observation whatever,
only barely said they had arrived.</p>

<p>The reader will not have forgotten the circumstance of the
four men, whom we mentioned were committed to close confinement
during the war, on suspicion of an intention to blow
up the ship. We, at this time, made application to the Board
of Transport, to mitigate the punishment of these four men,
late of the Surprise, and who had remained ever since in close
confinement in the cachot, but our petition was not granted;
the board said the sentence had passed and could not be recalled—they
must suffer according to the sentence. These
poor fellows had endured the three months imprisonment with
a magnanimity becoming Americans. The prisoners
seeing they could not get them relieved, agreed to allow them
a halfpenny a month out of every man’s pay, which was cheerfully
done by every man. They supplied them with such articles
as the board would allow them to have.</p>

<p>Our hope now brightened amidst the clouds of sufferings and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
despair, by the reports from Ghent of a speedy peace, which
swelled every London paper.</p>

<p>The guards, both officers and soldiers, stationed here, were
much disaffected with the government of the country; and informed
us that the military through the whole kingdom had
the same disaffection, and that they had gone so far as to inform
the government, in direct terms, that if a peace did not take
place before the first of April, that they would lay down their
arms.</p>

<p>The battle and destruction of Washington had now crossed
the Atlantic, and was sounding with great applause to the British
arms; every paper was swelled with the most pompous
description of the great battle, and the unparalleled bravery
and magnanimity of their officers and soldiers, that had defeated
and drove the whole American army, headed by Mr. Madison
in person, and that they were in so close pursuit of him that
he had a severe race all the way from Bladensburgh to Washington,
which they were disposed to ridicule by comparing to
John Gilpin’s celebrated race.</p>

<p>They also gave a description of Washington, which they declared
was one of the greatest cities in the known world; the
grandeur and magnificence of it surpassed that of Paris or London;
it contained thirteen hundred spacious squares. But they
did not mention that those squares contained no houses or inhabitants.</p>

<p>These stories could not gain the belief of persons acquainted
with the American nation and its capitol, but we were led to
believe that the conduct on both sides deserved much censure,
and that the burning of that capitol was a disgrace to both nations.</p>

<p>Nothing very material occurred among the prisoners this
month; they received their monthly pay as usual, but were
more sickly, and the weather cold and tedious, but could not
be compared with the November before. The prisoners,
though far from being as comfortable as they ought to be, suffered
much less, and were in a better condition to endure the
hardships of a prison than the year before, now they were supplied
with one pair of shoes and stockings, and allowed two and a
half pence per day. They did not shrink at the approaching
season so much as before.</p>

<p>Mr. Williams returned to London at the end of the month;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
he had been with us all the month, distributing the several articles
above mentioned.</p>

<p>As the season advanced the hard weather increased, and the
snow fell in great abundance in the beginning of December,
and the prisoners, much chilled with the cold, applied for permission
to keep fire, as had been permitted to the French
prisoners, but were peremptorily refused and absolutely forbid.</p>

<p>But to make the best of these evils of life, they applied themselves
every man to some occupation; they endeavored to
cherish and keep the mind alive if the body decayed, and to
cultivate that nobler part of our being, they established a number
of schools, and the young men and boys were instructed
in them for nearly two years, and many of them, who were
perfectly unacquainted with letters when they came to this
prison, had acquired a tolerable education in the English
branches of science.</p>

<p>There has, from the earliest ages of antiquity, been frequent
instances of men who have been weary of life, and had not the
courage and fortitude to bear those ills which are incident to
it, and have, therefore, by a sort of false heroism, attempted to
avoid them by destroying their own life. The Stoic philosophy,
which seemed to be a cultivated degree of insensibility,
encouraged it, and called it heroism; but the act is cowardly,
and a great offence against the laws of God and man.</p>

<p>I have thought proper to premise these observations, before
I related the melancholy instance of a young man, a native of
the city of New York, by the name of John Taylor, who put
an end to his life on the first of this month, by hanging himself,
in prison No. 5.</p>

<p>By the position in which he was found in the morning, he
must have been all intent on death; he had fastened himself
to one of the stantions so that his toes could just touch the floor.
We knew of no other cause than that despair had given him
less courage to live than to die.</p>

<p>Thinking it might tend to deter others from following the
example of this unhappy victim of despair, I procured a large
slate, and engraved on it the following inscription, which I put at
the head of his grave, where it remains on the moor:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p class="center">
Here lies<br>
<br>
JOHN TAYLOR,<br>
<br>
A native citizen of the city of New York,<br>
<br>
Who committed suicide, by hanging himself<br>
<br>
in prison No. 5, on the evening<br>
<br>
of the first of December, 1814.<br>
</p>

<p>I then put over each prison, as a <i>caveat</i>, the following <i>memento</i>,
as it was feared others would do the same act:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">He hung himself within yon walls,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A warning may it prove:</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One knows not how to account for the origin of that act
which takes away one’s own life: self-love and self-preservation
are so deeply rooted in the very nature of all living creatures,
that it is the ultimate motive of all actions to endeavor to
sustain and preserve life; fear of destroying it is so instinctive
in all animals that they seem to flee from danger without any
reasoning in the act, and almost without knowing when the volition
begins.</p>

<p>But the suicide reverses everything; he does an act which
is not natural, not rational, not desirable, and dangerous; he
rushes into the presence of his God with all his former crimes,
and this most heinous of all brings him there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>From the first to the twenty-sixth nothing material occurred,
but a constant fall of snow every day; but the season was less
severe than that of the year before.</p>

<p>In the interim, prisoners arrived from different quarters of
the globe; some taken in Canada on the lakes, and others on
the land; and amongst these arrivals was the crew of the privateer
Leo, captured off the coast of Portugal.</p>

<p>On the twenty-ninth, we were most agreeably surprised with
the joyful tidings of peace! The preliminaries were announced
in the London paper which we received this day, and
the news was confirmed by a letter from Mr. Beasley, received
the same day, stating that the treaty had been signed by the
Commissioners at Ghent, on the 24th, and that the sloop-of-war
Favorite would sail with the treaty on the second of January,
one thousand eight hundred and fifteen, with all possible speed,
for the United States, and that three months would release
every man from confinement.</p>

<p>Language is too feeble to describe the transports of joy that
so suddenly and unexpectedly filled every heart. Every man
forgot the many tedious days and nights he had so often numbered
over within these prison walls. The memory of his better
days rose fresh in his mind, and he once more hoped to return
to his native country, which he had so long despaired of
ever revisiting; his liberty, the embraces of his friends, he
knew better how to prize by being so long deprived of them.
The delicious fruits of plenty he could by his imagination
taste.</p>

<p>The prison was now in great confusion and bustle in preparing
to celebrate the peace, which we were confident would
be honorable to our country. We were confident that the
ground-work of the treaty must be free trade and sailors’ rights,
and made arrangements to celebrate it in a manner conformable
to the rights of the ocean.</p>

<p>We obtained a quantity of powder of the soldiers, unknown
to the keepers, and made large cartridges, wound them up in
twine, so that when exploded would make a report as loud as
a six-pounder; we then procured a large ensign, and a pendant
for each prison; we prepared a white flag in the centre,
painted in large capitals, “<span class="smcap">Free Trade and Sailors’ Rights</span>.”</p>

<p>The next morning, to the astonishment of the officers and
guards, we displayed the flags on the top of each prison; and
on No. 3, which was styled the Commodore, displayed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
white flag with the above motto, and at the same time fired a
salute of seventeen rounds.</p>

<p>Shortly after, Capt. Shortland entered the yard, and politely
requested the white flag, containing the motto, to be taken
down, as it would draw censure upon him from the government,
by holding out inducements for the sailors to mutinise;
he said the government of Great Britain took care to suppress
all such inflammatory mottoes. But the prisoners were too
full of spirits to comply with the request at that time. They
continued it till towards evening, when he again entered and
solicited us to take it down, or everything would be in confusion;
he said if we would take the motto-flag down, he would
hoist an American ensign on one end of his own house, and a
British one on the other end; and if we were not contented
with this he would order them all down; we then told him,
out of respect for him, we would take them all down, and
wait till the ratification of peace before we displayed them
again.</p>

<p>On the thirty-first of this month arrived a draft of prisoners,
among whom were many who had given themselves up
as American citizens, and claimed their right to a citizenship,
and refused to act on board his Majesty’s ships any longer;
these the prisoners did not give a very welcome reception, for
they had delayed till the act had become a wilful aiding and
assisting the enemy, and the mischief now over. The constant
cry among the sailors, who are great friends to Uncle Sam,
was, “Damn my eyes if he han’t stood it like a man.”</p>

<p>Among those prisoners who had declared themselves citizens
of the United States, were six who had been in the enemy’s
service for many years, and were on board His Majesty’s
ship Pelican when she engaged the United States brig Argus,
and took a very active part in the action against the Argus;
every man of them had been appointed to some petty office on
board the Pelican. But, supposing a peace would shortly be
concluded between the two nations, they had thought best to
claim a citizenship, and obtain their release. This information
soon spread among all the prisoners, and enraged them to
the highest degree at their conduct; and being flushed with
high spirits with the late news of peace, were about to proceed
to extremities with them, and they, finding their lives were in
danger, applied to Capt. Shortland for protection, who entered
the prison yard with guards and took these traitorous villains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
along, and we believe they went back into his Majesty’s service,
as the next day they were conveyed to Plymouth, and we
heard no more of them.</p>

<p>The weather was now very severe, and the oldest prisoners
had not received any clothing since May, and were much in
need of jackets and trowers, of this fact the prisoners were a
self-evident and naked truth. Many were sick in the hospital.</p>

<p>December thirty-first, 1814. Statement of prisoners in prison
at this depot:</p>

<p>Mr. Beasley, agent, had visited them once. They had received
from him one jacket, one pair of trowsers, two shirts,
two pair of shoes, and two pair of stockings, each man.</p>

<p>Received from the British government, one hammock, one
blanket, one horse rug, one bed, one yellow jacket, one pair of
trowers, one waistcoat, one pair of wooden shoes, and one cap.</p>

<p>Received in cash one and a half pence, to which was added
one penny more after two months, each man per day, from the
first of January, 1814.</p>

<p>The weather still continued cold, and the oldest prisoners
had not as yet received any shoes or clothes, but were daily
expecting them from Mr. Beasley.</p>

<p>We had been in this cold and dreary mansion twenty-one
months, and the above items were all the assistance we had received
from Beasley, the only person in this foreign land of our
enemies to whom we could look for any assistance, or from
whom we had any right to expect it.</p>

<p>Our ears had been constantly assailed with the groans of the
sick and the dying; pestilence and disease had been our constant
companions; our minds had become almost distracted betwixt
the grief for our departed friends and fellow-prisoners
and the hunger and want of our own body. From such a long
series of incessant sufferings, it is natural to suppose that the
bodies were emaciated and the mind debilitated; and much of
the sameness that may appear in this narrative is owing to a
uniform state of misery, which will not admit of a variety in
the description.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>Capt. Shortland had got information on the second of November,
1815, that the prisoners had counterfeited three shilling
pieces, and passed them to the market people, for their
country produce, and shortly after he detected two men attempting
to pass bad money; he had them apprehended immediately,
and sent to the cachot.</p>

<p>Nothing worthy of note occurred till the twentieth, when
two men lately arrived were discovered to be the same who
had entered the British service the winter before. After having
received many insults, and much hard usage, on board the
war ships, they had got tired of their situations, and claimed
their citizenship and got themselves delivered up and sent to
prison again, which they considered the least of the two evils.</p>

<p>Their conduct on board the ships, was no doubt as disgraceful
as the act they committed to bring them there; they shifted
from ship to ship, till the one wherein they claimed their citizenship
was ignorant of the manner they had come into the service.
The prisoners being highly enraged at such conduct,
made strict inquiry into the matter, and found the facts as above
mentioned.—After holding consultations, many were for putting
them to immediate death, others were for flogging them as severely
as they could bear, and every man for giving them
some condign punishment; but at last it was unanimously concluded
to put upon them a mark, which would be a lasting
stigma, and an example for others. They seized and took the
traitors into prison, and fastened them to a table, so that they
could not resist, and then, with needles and India ink, pricked
U. S. on one cheek, and T. on the other; which is United
States Traitor. After we let them go, they were taken immediately
to the hospital, and their faces blistered on both sides,
to endeavor to extract the ink, but this only made it brighter
and sink deeper in. The doctors reported the traitors to be in
a very dangerous state, and that their lives were despaired of.
If this had been the case, it must only proceed from the application
they had made use of, for no harm could arise from marking.</p>

<p>The next day, Capt Shortland being offended at the treatment
of his friends had received, sent and had three men taken,
whom he suspected were concerned in the affair, and put them
into the cachot, where they were examined not long after by the
King’s solicitor, and there ordered to remain till the next Exeter
assizes, then and there to be tried by the laws of this country.
On the twenty-fifth arrived five hundred suits of clothes, which
were distributed among those who had last arrived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>The weather being very severe, and great quantities of snow
falling, the men were obliged to keep within doors. On the
same day arrived a regiment of regular troops, who themselves
had been prisoners in France for many years during the late
war between that nation and England.—They were much
disgusted with the treatment we received here, and exclaimed
against the authors of it, whoever they might be, and declared
they had not received such treatment in France.</p>

<p>At this time, the government not being so strict in their
charge the military, and the keepers not so strict in putting
them in execution, and these new guards being very friendly,
gave us a fine opportunity to escape over the walls, and many
made their escape in dark stormy nights. This continued for
some time, till one man was taken on the wall, in the very act;
then it was stopped, and strict orders given.</p>

<p>On the twenty-sixth a draft of prisoners arrived, among
whom were the crew of the privateer Neuf-Chattel of New
York, lately captured, and two navy officers captured on the
lakes. On the twenty-eighth these officers received their parole,
and proceeded on to Ashburton, where all the paroled
officers were stationed.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Nantucket Neutrality.</i></p>

<p>On the thirtieth, Sir Isaac Coffin arrived with another British
admiral; Sir Isaac is a native of Massachusetts, and feeling
some partiality to his native statesmen, requested Capt. Shortland
to permit all the men who belonged to Nantucket to come
alone into market square, which request was of course granted.
He himself and the other admiral, whose name we did not
learn, held a long conversation with the Nantucket men, and
inquired the particulars of their birth, their friends and places
of residence; they then told them, should the war continue,
they would be released, on account of belonging to a neutral
Country.—They then took an affectionate leave of the citizens
of that neutral nation, and went away. Such are the advantages
derived from being a neutral nation in the time of war.</p>

<p>February commences with much snow and cold; the prisoners
in great anxiety for the ratification of the treaty.</p>

<p>On the fourth arrived a draft of prisoners, lately captured in
the privateer Brutus. At this time a new, and most dreadful
calamity now alarmed and endangered the life of every man;
the African pox had, by some unfortunate means, got among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
the prisoners, and threatened destruction to every living soul.
The disorder was so violent that when it attacked a person,
he had nothing to expect but immediate death; numbers
died daily.</p>

<p>On the fifth, the London papers mentioned two American
frigates cruising in the channel, which excited great alarm.</p>

<p>On the sixth, the pestilence had grown so mortal, that the
chief surgeon in England visited the prison; he imagined the
distemper to arise from a want of pure air; that so many
people crowded together in one building must render the air
very impure, and unfit for respiration. He tried the difference
of temperature of the air in the prison, and outside,
which he found to differ twenty-five degrees by Farenheit’s
thermometer, the air being much warmer inside. This difference
of heat arose entirely from the heat of the human body,
as no fire was kept in the prisons; each prison now contained
about 1200 persons on an average. It is highly probable the
distemper had generated itself in the bad state of air, and had
not been introduced from abroad, as was first supposed.</p>

<p>On the eighth arrived an order from the Board of Transport,
for Capt. Shortland to ascertain the number and description of
all prisoners belonging to the Island of Nantucket, for the purpose
of giving them their discharge; like the citizens of Denmark
and Sweden, they were neutral.</p>

<p>On the tenth arrived a draft of prisoners, lately captured on
their voyage to France; on the same day a number of prisoners
were called on to give evidence on the part of the crown,
concerning the marking the traitors in the cheek.</p>

<p>The king’s solictor was a long while busy in endeavouring
to obtain information, but all the satisfaction he got was, that
they had heard by report that the men that marked the traitors,
were to be tried at Exeter the next assizes. At the same time
a small quantity of clothing arrived from Mr. Beasley, who
it seemed always took care to send clothing to those who last
arrived, as in this instance, although they had not been prisoners
but a few weeks; he seemed to have an idea that they
always come into prison naked, and when they were there, one
suit would last them all their life; for the oldest prisoners had
not received any clothing since the last May, and it was now
ten months, and every garment entirely worn out. He supposed,
that during two years imprisonment, such as we had had,
we must have got used to every species of hardship, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
going naked was so slight an evil that we did not mind it
at all.</p>

<p>During the interval of time since the peace, another <i>slight</i>
evil, somewhat similar to the above, had befallen us, for the
contractor, seeing we were shortly to go to a land of plenty,
was determined to show us the difference in a man’s feelings
between eating and going without; so he gave us no more
than the simpleton gave his horse while learning him to live
without eating.</p>

<p>On the thirteenth, one of the four prisoners, whom we mentioned
before were sentenced last August to remain in the
cachot during the war, watched an opportunity to get among
the other prisoners in the yard, being let into the yard of that
building for the benefit of the fresh air, and seeing the attention
of the turnkeys and soldiers occupied by some other object,
at this time jumped over the iron railing that separated
this building from the yards of Nos. 1, 2, and 3, and got undiscovered
amongst the other prisoners; the morning following
he was missed by the keepers, and information given to Capt.
Shortland, who demanded the man from among us immediately
that he be returned to the cachot again.</p>

<p>The prisoners positively refused to give the man up, and
declared that no force of arms should wrest him from their
protection. He then ordered the market closed, and would
not allow any communication with it, and refused the prisoners
every privilege, and gave them only their allowance.</p>

<p>On the fourteenth, he entered the yard at the head of two
hundred soldiers with fixed bayonets, and ordered every prisoner
to retire within the prisons, that search might be made
for the prisoner, and he again remanded to the cachot; but
all the prisoners having previously agreed to stand by each
other, and if they attempted to use any violence, to surround
and disarm them; a signal was given to surround, and the
soldiers were immediately surrounded, and the intention made
known to the officers, and advised to retire, unless they were
determined to risk the consequence. They then very prudently
ordered the soldiers to fall back, and retire without the
yard, and leave the man whom they sought.</p>

<p>The captain still harboring rancor in his breast, thought to
compel us to give up the man by force of starvation, and kept
the markets closed against us, and compelled us to subsist
solely on our scant allowance; but we, to retaliate, forbid all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
prisoners going out of the yard to work, who at this time were
about forty or fifty carpenters, masons, and other mechanics,
who were a great profit to the government; this step put
Shortland to great expense and inconvenience to procure
others.</p>

<p>He at last concluded to make peace and restore tranquility,
and let the man remain; and, on the twentieth, he again
opened the markets to the prisoners, and we permitted the
workmen to go out and work again. The other three men
remained in the cachot, but a stronger guard was placed?
there, otherwise we were determined to release them by force.</p>

<p>On the twenty-second, arrived a draft of prisoners, lately
captured off the Cape of Good Hope, among whom were
the crew of the late United States brig Syren; the treatment of
these men before they arrived at this place will be mentioned
in the supplements to this work. These, together with others
taken in other parts, arrived since the last enumeration on the
last day of one thousand eight hundred and fourteen, made in all
at this depot five thousand eight hundred and fifty, which were
all the prisoners in England, except officers on parole.
The prisoners were barefooted, and very sickly.</p>

<p>On the twenty-sixth of this month, is gazetted in the London
papers, the official account of the capture of the United States
frigate President, Com. Decatur.</p>

<p>The editor says she was captured solely by the Endymion,
of far inferior force; he says the engagement was in the old
English style, yard-arm to yard-arm. Knowing this to be
a falsehood, I addressed a letter to the editor, requesting him
to read a short piece of poetry which I enclosed.</p>

<p>March commenced with cold and blustering weather, and
the prison almost one continued scene of sick and dying, the
small-pox was raging with a desolating aspect, and the greatest
anxiety concerning the ratification of the treaty; afflictions,
which seem never to come singly, were now pressing upon
the back of one another; pestilence, famine and nakedness
were not affliction enough, phrensy must be added.</p>

<p>On the fourth, a man in the hospital, in a sudden fit of insanity,
seized a knife and stabbed two of the nurses very dangerously,
of which wounds Jonathan Paul died on the tenth,
the other survived.</p>

<p>On inquiry into the circumstances of the deceased, we found
him to have been a married man, and his wife had lived a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
distance from the prison since his confinement, who was in
very narrow circumstances.</p>

<p>We all agreed to give her the day’s allowance of fish of that
week, which we sold to the contractor and received the money,
which amounted to nearly one hundred dollars; this sum she
received, and returned to her residence on the day of the death
of her husband.</p>

<p>On this day, also, the three men who were put into close
confinement for marking the traitors on the face, were taken
out of the custody of the agent of prisoners of war at this place,
by a writ of <i>habeas corpus ad respodendum</i>, and removed to the
criminal prison at Exeter, to be tried for the offence by the
civil laws of this country. They were removed in irons. The
prisoners then made a contribution for the support of these
men while at Exeter.</p>

<p>On the tenth, we received London papers, which gave an
account of Bonaparte’s having arrived in France at the head
of about one thousand men, and that he was making the most
rapid advances toward Paris, and thousands joining him;
that the greatest confusion was taking place in the affairs of
France.</p>

<p>This intelligence struck the greatest astonishment in all
England, and created a very serious concern among all the
military, who expected to be relieved on the arrival of the
treaty ratified by the President, but now they must despair of
that idea, as new wars must inevitably follow the steps of that
gigantic monster.</p>

<p>On the fourteenth, a universal joy was diffused through the
whole prison, and “a smile lighted up in the aspect of woe;”
the Favorite, the welcome messenger of peace, arrived, and
brought the treaty, ratified by the President of the United
States.</p>

<p>I cannot better express the joy that diffused itself through
the whole country, Englishmen as well as prisoners, than by
giving the following lines from a great author:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The dumb shall sing, the lame his crutch forego,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And leap exulting like the bounding roe.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No sigh nor murmur the wide world shall hear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From ev’ry face he wipes off ev’ry tear.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We raised the ensigns and pendant on each prison; presented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
to Capt. Shortland, and gentlemen under his command,
an address in poetry.</p>

<p>On the seventeenth, we were informed by Capt. Shortland,
that he had received orders from the Board of Transport to
discharge the prisoners whenever Mr. Beasley was ready to
receive them. To the great disappointment of all the prisoners
we had received no information from Mr. Beasley for six
weeks, and the prisoners now were in the greatest anxiety.
They reasonably expected that on the arrival of this ratified
treaty, Mr. Beasley would have everything in a state of readiness
for their immediate conveyance to the United States, and
that he would inform them in what manner they were to proceed
there; but not a syllable was received from the agent of
our country till the eighteenth, when a very cold and unpleasant
letter was received from him, which read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>Fellow-citizens</i>,—
</p>

<p>I am informed that great numbers of the prisoners refuse
being inoculated with the small-pox, which I hear has been
very mortal among you, I therefore acquaint you that it will
be impossible for me to send home any prisoners unless they
have gone through the same. Yours, &amp;c.,</p>

<p class="author">
R. G. BEASLEY.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>This strange letter rather increased the great anxiety every
man was in, for we expected to have been informed something
relative to our speedy departure, and that he had made arrangements
to clothe the oldest prisoners, who were so naked
that they were unfit to be discharged.</p>

<p>On the nineteenth, an order arrived, informing Capt. Shortland
to discharge thirty men, as they had been applied for by
American captains, to man ships in France and up the east
country; the Transport Board had ordered them to be discharged.</p>

<p>On the twentieth, Capt. Shortland released those three
men whom we have mentioned were committed to close confinement
in the cachot last August, on suspicion of blowing up
the vessel; the other, we have mentioned, made his escape.</p>

<p>These men made as ghastly an appearance as it is possible
for human beings to make; they had been eight months confined
within a damp stone room, twenty feet square, floored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
with stone, and no light except a dim ray that gleamed
through the top of the gable end. They had lived on two-thirds
of a scant allowance till their trembling limbs could
scarce support their body.</p>

<p>On the same day, a writ came to remove the insane man
who had occasioned the death of Jonathan Paul to Exeter, to
have his trial; also one to bring forward about twenty persons
as witnesses, in this and the trial of the three men whom
we mentioned had been taken there for trial for marking the
traitors.</p>

<p>The small-pox raged now in a most alarming manner; it
being of the African kind, scarce a man recovered after once
being attacked and conveyed to the hospital.</p>

<p>After the arrival of the ratification of the treaty, great numbers
visited the prison, from all parts of the country, with almost
every kind of article for sale in the markets, among whom
were great numbers of Jews, who came here to sell old
clothes.</p>

<p>One of these Jew merchants, on his way to the prison, met
a farmer who lived about eight miles from the prison, and accused
him of being an American prisoner, making his escape
from the depot, as great numbers had lately made their escape;
and, thinking to receive the reward, which was three pounds,
given by the government for apprehending any prisoner making
his escape from the prison, told the farmer he must go
back to the prison with him; and the farmer, having been
once a sailor, was willing to confirm him in his suspicions,
and began the song of Yankee Doodle; this confirmed the
Jew in his belief of his being an American, and he was sure
he had got a prize worth three pounds to him; but his prisoner
refused to walk, and thinking he could afford to hire a
conveyance for him, gave half a guinea to a wagoner to take
him to the prison, and treated him very liberally along the
way with drink. About 11 o’clock the Jew arrived with his
prisoner, and applied to the keepers to take charge of him,
and pay the reward of three pounds; but to his astonishment,
the clerks, turnkeys, and every officer, immediately knew the
farmer, and knew him to be a respectable man residing on the
edge of the moor. He now demanded of the Jew a compensation
for being detained several hours a prisoner, and the demand
being justified by Capt. Shortland, the Jew was obliged
to pay five pounds to prevent a suit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>The affair was made known to the prisoners, and every
man forbid purchasing anything of the Jew; he was therefore
obliged to leave the market without disposing of a single
article.</p>

<p>On the twenty-fourth, a letter was received from Mr. Beasley,
informing those Americans who had been taken under
the French flag, and had been considered French prisoners
till they were discharged, and from that time till this, had been
recognised by no government, that he was now authorized to
acknowledge them as Americans, and sent to each man a suit
of clothes. This was the first assistance these men had had
from any government since the French prisoners were discharged,
and had lived entirely on the charity of the other
prisoners. They had been prisoners four or five years.</p>

<p>The same letter informed us that he had taken three ships
at London for the conveyance of the prisoners to the United
States.</p>

<p>The same day a passport for four prisoners, who were to
be discharged, was received.</p>

<p>During this month many prisoners made their escape, the
government appearing very careless; and it was supposed this
negligence was intentional, that they might escape for the
purpose of impressing, as the press was hot about this time;
but some few were detected when passing the wall, and sentenced
to the cachot for ten days, on two-thirds allowance,
which stopped the escaping for that time.</p>

<p>On the twenty-fifth the prisoners began to be impatient of
such delay in the American agent, as eleven days had elapsed
since the arrival of the ratified treaty, and nothing in readiness
to discharge them, no means provided, and such delay too much
to be borne; their situation was such that they could not restrain
their resentment against such criminal neglect as their
agent was guilty of; they were determined to punish him as much
as it lay in their power; they therefore caused his effigy to be
hanged on the top of one of the prisons, after which it was taken
down, and burnt in presence of all the officers and soldiers—But
I must not forget to mention the sentence of the court, pronounced
before his execution, and his dying confession, when
under the gallows.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Sentence.</i></p>

<p>At this trial, held at Dartmoor on the twenty-fifth day of
March, one thousand eight hundred and fifteen, you, Reuben<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
G. Beasley in effigy, are found guilty, by an impartial and
judicious jury of your countrymen, upon the testimony of five
thousand seven hundred witnesses, of depriving many hundreds
of your countrymen of their lives, by the most wanton
and most cruel deaths, by nakedness, starvation, and exposure
to pestilence. It therefore becomes the duty of this court, as
ought to be the duty of every court of justice, to pronounce that
sentence of the law, which your manifold and heinous crimes
so richly deserve.—And it is with the deepest regret that I
am compelled to say, our country has been imposed upon, by
a man whose crimes must cut him off from among the living.
You this day must be hanged by the neck on the top of the
prison No. 7, until you are dead; your body is then to be
taken down and fastened to a stake, and burned to ashes,
which are to be distributed to the winds, that your name may
be forgotten, and your crimes no longer disgrace our nation.</p>

<p>On hearing the above sentence, the compunction of his conscience
now brought forth the following confession:</p>


<p class="center">CONFESSION.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Injured countrymen and fellow-citizens</i>:</p>

<p>I this day, by the verdict of a just and impartial jury,
and by the sentence of an impartial court, am to be made a
public example, and receive that punishment which is so
justly due to my many odious offences against the laws of
God and my country; and being in a very few moments to
make my exit from this world, do confess, in the presence of
Almighty God, that for the first twelve months of my consulship
I did most criminally neglect the American prisoners,
who were dying daily for the want of my assistance, which I
withheld through mercenary motives: the cries and petitions
of my unfortunate countrymen I have always treated with the
utmost disregard and contempt, but being fully convinced of
all my past errors, I make this public and candid confession,
in hopes that I may find mercy in the presence of a just and
merciful God. I further do acknowledge, that I have been
the means of detaining you in your present situation by neglecting
to send you home, as I might have done, while the
exchange was open for prisoners, which was not closed till
June, eighteen hundred and thirteen; I likewise confess, that
I have deprived great numbers of you of your regular turns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
of exchange, by filling the cartels with paroled officers, who
were not entitled to the same; I must confess that had I have
made proper application to the British government, and
had I used my influence, I might have obtained the release of
all the men discharged from his majesty’s ships of war; but
being selfish, and swayed by despicable motives, I made no
exertions for their relief. I do likewise confess, that after the
second year of my consulship, I could no longer withhold
from my unfortunate countrymen, some little assistance in
money and clothing, as the United States had given me positive
orders to supply all the wants of her citizens, who were
prisoners of war at that time in England; but to my shame,
and to the disgrace of any American agent, I entered in a
contract with a <i>Jew merchant</i> of London, to supply the prisoners
with the very meanest and coarsest clothing that could
possibly be procured in all England. At the same time I
made advances to you, prisoners, of two and a half cents per
day, and then represented to your country, the Congress of the
United States, that I had supplied all your wants by providing
you a sufficient quantity of clothing, and making you a daily
advance of money suitable to your wants; for I did think that
by deceiving the United States, and depriving you of the necessaries
of life, I should in a very few years accumulate to
myself a very handsome fortune; but to my great disappointment
and disgrace, the peace took place, and all my villany
and deception was discovered; my crimes stood in open day.
For these crimes now I am justly doomed to this ignominious
death, and must very shortly make my appearance before the
just and Almighty God, to answer for all my crimes; where
I expect there will rise up in evidence against me, the souls
of hundreds of my departed countrymen, who now lie buried
behind the walls of this prison by my crimes; as the time is
now expired, I must depart to the uncertainty of an hereafter.</p>
</div>

<p>The hat drops.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I depart among the damned.</p>
</div>


<p>After the ashes was scattered in the winds, the following
dirge was then sung:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The image of disgrace we’ve hang’d,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>
<p>On the twenty-sixth, the prisoners who had been taken to
Exeter to give evidence against the insane man who stabbed
Paul, and also those who were to give evidence against the
three men who were accused of marking the traitors, returned
to Dartmoor; as did also the defendants who had had their
trial, and were acquitted.</p>

<p>On the twenty-eighth, we received our monthly pay as
usual: the prison continued very sickly, and no preparation
for our departure.</p>

<p>At this time the officers and soldiers of the garrison seemed
greatly alarmed and much concerned at the news received
from France. They had the greatest apprehensions of an immediate
war with Bonaparte, as the Paris papers gave an account
of his being at the head of three hundred thousand men
in arms; and the British papers mentioned the great preparations
they were making in this country to assist the allies.
The very name of the Emperor, and the mention of the battle
of New-Orleans, made every British officer and soldier
turn pale, and shudder at the thought.</p>

<p>On the last day of March, I collected the exact number of
all prisoners at this depot, and noted as follows:</p>


<table class="autotable">

<p>On the same day we received letters from London, informing
us that the ships taken for our conveyance, lay wind
bound in the Downs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>The month concluded with pleasant weather for Dartmoor;
sickness and small pox had somewhat abated.</p>

<p>The prisoners made a contribution for the assistance of a
prisoner, who had lost an arm in attempting to take possession
of the cartel, which was conveying them from Halifax
to England.</p>

<p>As this is intended to be a true and faithful account of all
the occurrences and circumstances of the American captives
in England, we cannot forbear mentioning some circumstances,
which may appear trifling and uninteresting to those
who have not felt as we have.</p>

<p>The weather now being mild, and the pleasant season for
crossing the Atlantic fast approaching, the prisoners felt the
most insufferable anxiety for their departure. The winds
being favorable, and seventeen days having elapsed since the
ratified treaty arrived, they could not but wait with impatience
for the cartels.</p>

<p>On the first of March, Capt. Shortland received orders to
discharge twenty-one prisoners, who had applied to be released
in England. Previous to this time almost all the men
who had been delivered from the British ships of war, had
been paid at different times their prize money, and the wages
due for their past services in the navy.</p>

<p>This day a man by the name of Bratt, who had belonged to
the United States’ brig Argus returned to prison. This man,
at the time we were attempting to make our escape by digging
out, was accused of dropping some unguarded expression,
which had led to a discovery of our first attempt; he was
threatened to be put to death, by great numbers of prisoners,
and the keepers fearing this might be the case, took him to
the guard house, where he remained till the crew of the
Argus were discharged from prison, when he was also discharged
with them, and went along with the crew to Dartmouth,
and entered the cartel; he was there accused of the
same as before, and threatened, and fearing his life might be
taken, he escaped from the cartel, went into the country and
worked at his trade, which was that of a blacksmith, and had
resided there the whole time.</p>

<p>On the second we had information that the ship Milo, of
Boston, had arrived in England in eighteen days from that
port; she was the first American vessel which had reached
this place since the peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>On the same day, we received a letter from Mr. Beasley,
which read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>Fellow Citizens</i>,
</p>

<p>From the numberless letters I receive daily, I find that
the prisoners entertain an idea of my releasing any prisoners
that are enabled with a sufficiency to provide for themselves;
I therefore must give you fully my intention on that subject,
which is, to grant passports only to such persons as have
friends or connexions in this country, of responsibility.</p>

<p>I must also acquaint you that I am making every possible
dispatch with the cartels for your conveyance to the United
States, where you are much wanted, and the encouragement
for seamen very great.</p>
</div>

<p>This letter again revived the drooping spirits of the prisoners,
who for many days had been almost distracted with the
tedium of suspense. We now felt that a few days would
release us from this earthly hell, and like Ænas of old, pass
by propitious gales from hell to heaven, and shortly repose
on the Elysian fields, in the arms of the goddess of liberty.</p>

<p>The prisoners that had kept shops in the prisons for retailing
small articles, such as tobacco, thread, soap, coffee, sugar,
&amp;c. now broke up, and every thing was in great confusion
for want of these articles; these shops were a great advantage
to those who kept them, and a great accommodation to
all the prisoners. There had been from sixty to eighty in
each prison; at these places all these small articles might
easily be obtained, though at somewhat higher price than in
the market.</p>

<p>Our salary would not go far in purchasing these articles,
which were very high at this time all over England; we
could buy for a penny sterling, only one small chew of
tobacco, which was selling at Plymouth by the quantity at
nine shillings and six pence per pound.</p>

<p>We find mentioned in the paper of this day, the arrival of
the late U. States frigate President at Plymouth; they barely
mention that she had arrived at that place, and that she was
captured by the Endymion, but the circumstances of the
capture they very prudently left out, as reflecting no honor
on the captors.</p>

<p>Capt. Shortland had two men committed to close confinement,
who had been accused of drawing money from the
Directors of Greenwich Hospital, under assumed names.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>On the fourth, a circumstance occurred, which may lead to
the recital of other circumstances, which many to whose
hand this work may come, may be inclined to doubt the
veracity of; but I can appeal, not only to those who have
certified this work, but to nearly six thousand of my fellow
prisoners, who upon their solemn oath can attest to the truth
of what is herein contained.</p>

<p>During the whole of this day the prisoners remained
without bread, and the captain of the prison gone to Plymouth:
we were obliged to subsist on the four and a half
ounces of beef, and the soup made of it; we demanded of the
contractor the reason of our not drawing our usual allowance
of bread; he answered, that it could not be obtained till to-morrow;
we waited as patiently as our feelings would allow,
till the expiration of thirty-six hours from the time we had
received the last bread, when hunger became so pressing,
that it drove us to a state of desperation, and we could no
longer endure it, as the whole allowance was scarcely sufficient
to sustain life. At dusk in the evening, we again
demanded the reason of our not receiving our allowance of
bread as usual, as the store-house we well knew contained
a sufficiency of both hard and soft bread. The contractor’s
clerk informed us, that a quantity of damaged hard bread,
which had been kept in reserve for times of extreme necessity,
now remained on hand, and that unless we would accept
of one pound of that in lieu of the pound and a half of soft
bread allowed by the Transport Board, until all they had was
expended, he should not serve us with any bread, until Capt.
Shortland returned from Plymouth.</p>

<p>The prisoners then collected themselves into companies, to
consider of this very extraordinary conduct in the contractor;
and after mature deliberation, they all concluded that it must
be a design in the contractor to get rid of his damaged bread,
before we went away, and had taken this opportunity, while
the captain was absent, to compel us to receive it by starving
us till we were willing; we therefore concluded rather to die
by the sword, than the famine, and determined to remain no
longer in this starving condition, for we had all this time
lived solely on the four and a half ounces of beef. Thus
desperate by starvation, we determined to force open the
gates in front of the prison, disarm the soldiers, break open
the store-house and supply ourselves; and provided the garrison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
should charge or fire upon us, to make a general
attack, and take possession of the guard house and barracks,
and stand the consequences let come what might. Accordingly
at dark, the prisoners were ordered, as usual, inside the
prisons to be locked up for the night, but instead of complying
with orders, a signal previously agreed on was given,
and passed like lightning through every prison, and every
prisoner appeared instantly at the gate in one solid body; on
approaching the gates, and bursting open the first three, the
soldiers and turnkeys stationed there, fled in the utmost confusion
and consternation to the main body in the guard house.
The alarm-bells rung and the drums in every direction
around the garrison beat to arms; the women in the different
houses connected to the depot, flew in confusion and terror in
every direction from the depot; in a few moments the alarm
had reached the neighboring villages for many miles, and
the militia assembled in arms to assist the garrison, which
was at this time twelve hundred. We stood arranged in front
of the store-house ready to receive the attack of the soldiery,
or receive our usual allowance of bread; in a few moments
the soldiers arrived and advanced with charged bayonets
within two yards of the prisoners. The soldiers were then
brought to a stand by the threats of the prisoners who all
declared, in the most determined tone, that if they attempted
to fire or make a charge on them, they must abide by any
consequences that would follow: we told them that we were
confident that no such orders had been issued by the government
of Great Britain; we also told them, that unless the
bread was served out immediately, that the store-house should
be levelled with the ground, and every prisoner should
march out of the prison. The contractor, clerks, &amp;c. then
immediately came forward and entered into this engagement,
that if the prisoners would retire into the prison yards, that
the bread should be immediately served to them; the prisoners
agreed and retired, and for the securing the fulfilment of
the engagement, they took with them as a hostage one of the
clerks inside of the prison, and there to remain till every
prisoner had received his usual allowance of bread, which
was not till after twelve o’clock at night. During this time,
the guards, soldiers, keepers, and every person connected
with the prison, remained in the greatest apprehension,
fearing the prisoners had some further intention than merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
to obtain their bread; they feared their troubles would end in
a more serious way, and the prisoners all make their escape.
But next morning showed that the prisoners had no intention
of escaping, for during the confusion of the night, many of
them had taken the opportunity to scale the walls in an opposite
direction, while the attention of the guard was taken up
with the main body of them.</p>

<p>Those that had gone out after remaining all night, came and
demanded admittance into prison again. This movement in
the prisoners astonished the natives of the moor, who left vacant
their huts and fled for safety; and the women and children
had retired to the nearest towns, and there took refuge,
and the men had joined the garrison for protection.</p>

<p>During the night an express was sent to Plymouth to acquaint
Capt. Shortland of the event, and that the prisoners had
complete possession of the whole garrison, and the control of
all things at Dartmoor. In the morning Capt. Shortland arrived
with a reinforcement of two hundred soldiers; but found
all things quiet and tranquil; as the prisoners had obtained
their usual allowance of bread, they were satisfied and sought
nothing more. Capt. Shortland made an apology for the conduct
of the contractor, and things passed on tolerably well;
but great suspicions remained among the people who had formerly
attended the market, and these had spread abroad and
become the general opinion outside the walls, that the American
prisoners being detained so long since the ratification had
arrived, now three weeks, in which time Mr. Beasley might
have had all discharged and on their passage to the United
States, had grown impatient; and as no ships had yet sailed
from London to receive them, their forbearance was quite exhausted,
and from some threats that had been thrown out by
some of the prisoners in presence of the market people, that if
the agent of their country did not procure their release within
one month from the arrival of the treaty, that they would take
their liberty in a body, being determined to risk their lives at
all hazards, and depend on their own exertions for their liberty
among armed soldiers, rather than remain in the wretched
condition they were then in. These suspicions had gone so
much abroad, that every body about the prison was apprehensive
the prisoners would make the attempt to escape in a body,
and some unhappy issue grow out of it. But the prisoners
generally had no design of escaping, as by that means they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
would lose their opportunity of returning home in the cartels.
On the sixth, we addressed a letter to Mr. Beasley, on the
subject of our discharge, and informed him that we had made
application to the British Government to interfere in forwarding
our release, as he, Mr. Beasley, had delayed the time already
nearly one month, and had only procured three ships,
and them still in London, when at the same time ships could
have been procured at Plymouth, on equally as good terms as
at London, which would, with very little exertion on the part
of Mr. Beasley, have released the greater part of the prisoners
in two weeks from the arrival of the ratification of the treaty.</p>

<p>The story I am about to relate is of the deepest concern, as
well to every citizen of the United States as to those who were
the immediate subjects of it. The event concerns the interest
of both governments, and deserve to be treated in the most
candid and impartial manner; every transaction whereby the
intention of those acting in it can be discovered, require to be
shown in the purest and most open view.</p>

<p>That the public may have all that can be known on this
important subject, I purpose to lay before them, in the first instance,
what passed within my own knowledge, that I myself
was witness to; then to give them the report of the committee
appointed by the prisoners to investigate the circumstances of
the massacre; and lastly, to give the report of the agents appointed
by the two governments.</p>

<p>What one of that Nation, or what soldier of that hardened,
wretched band, can refrain from tears even while he relates the
murderous deeds?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“What blind, detested madness could afford,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such horrid license to the murd’ring sword!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Though the scene is of painful memory, and my soul shudders
at the remembrance, and hath shrunk back with grief at
the thought, yet will I relate what my eyes hath seen and my
ears heard.</p>

<p>On the sixth of this month, April, about six o’clock in the
evening, Capt. Shortland discovered a hole in the inner wall,
that separates the barrack-yard from prison No. 6 and 7; this
hole had been made in the afternoon by some prisoners out of
mere play, without any design to escape.</p>

<p>On discovering the hole, Capt. Shortland seemed instantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
to conceive the murderous design; for, without giving the
prisoners any notice to retire, he planted soldiers in proper
positions on the top of the wall, where they could best assist
in perpetrating his murderous and barbarous deeds.</p>

<p>A few minutes past six, while the prisoners were innocently,
and unapprehensive of danger, walking in the prison yards
and those in No. 1, 3 and 4 were particularly so, as the yards
of these prisons are entirely separated every way from the
yard in which the hole in the wall had been made—the alarm
bells rung, and the drums of the garrison in every direction
beat to arms; this was about ten minutes past six.</p>

<p>This sudden and unexpected alarm excited the attention of
all the prisoners, who, out of curiosity made immediately for
the prison yard to inquire the reason of the alarm.</p>

<p>Among so many as were in this depot, it is reasonable to
suppose that some mischievous persons were among them,
and among those collected at the gate were some such persons
who forced the gate open, whether by accident or design I
will not attempt to say; but without any intention of making an
escape, and totally unknown to every man, except the few who
stood in front of the gates; those back naturally crowded forward
to see what was going on at the gates; this pressed and
forced a number through the gates, quite contrary to the intention
of either those in front or those in rear.</p>

<p>While in this situation Capt. Shortland entered the inner
square, at the head of the whole body of soldiers in the garrison;
as soon as they entered, Capt. Shortland took sole
command of the whole, and immediately drew up the soldiers
in a position to charge.</p>

<p>The soldier-officers, perceiving by this move the horrid and
murderous design of Capt. Shortland, resigned their authority
over the soldiers, and refused to take any part, or give any
orders for the troop to fire.</p>

<p>They saw by this time that the terrified prisoners were retiring
as fast as so great a crowd would permit, and hurrying
and flying in terrible flight, in every direction, to their respective
prisons.</p>

<p>The troop had now advanced within three yards of the
prisoners, when Capt. Shortland gave them orders to charge
upon them; at this time the prisoners had all got within their
respective prison yards, and were flying with the greatest precipitation
from the point of the bayonet; the doors now being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
full of the terrified crowd, they could not enter as fast as they
wished; at this moment of dismay, Capt. Shortland was distinctly
heard to give orders to the troops to fire upon the prisoners,
although now completely in his power, and their lives
at his disposal, and had offered no violence, nor attempted to
resist, and the gates all closed.</p>

<p>The order was immediately obeyed by his soldiers, and they
discharged a full volley of musketry into the main body of the
prisoners, on the other side of the iron railings which separated
the prisoners from the soldiers.</p>

<p>These volleys were repeated for several rounds, and the
prisoners falling, either dead or wounded, in all directions,
while it was yet impossible for them to enter the prison, on
account of the numbers that flew there for refuge from the rage
of the blood thirsty murderer.</p>

<p>In the midst of this horrid slaughter, one man among the
rear prisoners, with great presence of mind and the most undaunted
courage, turned and advanced to the soldiers, amidst
the fire of hundreds, and while his fellow-prisoners were falling
all around him, and in an humble and suppliant manner,
with his hat in his hand, this resolute soul, in the face of
danger and death, implored mercy of Capt. Shortland to spare
his countrymen. “O! spare my countrymen!” he cried, “O!
Captain, forbear, don’t kill us all.” To this supplication, this
cruel, inexorable Shortland replied, “Retire, you dammed rascal;
I’ll hear to nothing.” The soldiers then pricked him
with their bayonets, which compelled him to retreat to the prison
door, where he must wait his doom with the other unfortunate
prisoners, till the soldiers, who had now entered the different
prison yards, and were pursuing and firing should dispatch
him with the rest.</p>

<p>To do justice to the merits of this young man, I must inform
the public that his name is Greenlow, of Virginia, and late a
midshipman in the United States navy, but now a prisoner of
the crew of the privateer Prince of Neufchattel.</p>

<p>The soldiers now advanced, making a general massacre of
men and boys, whom accident or impossibility had left without
the doors of the prison; they advanced near to the crowded
doors, and instantly discharged another volley of musketry on
the backs of those farthest out, endeavoring to force their passage
into the prison.</p>

<p>This barbarous act was repeated in the presence of this inhuman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
monster, Shortland—and the prisoners fell, either dead
or severely wounded, in all directions, before his savage sight.</p>

<p>But his vengeance was not glutted by the cruel murder of
the innocent men and boys that lay weltering and bleeding in
the groans and agonies of death along the prison-doors, but
turned and traversed the yard, and hunted a poor affrighted
wretch, that had flew for safety close under the walls of prison
No. 1, and dared not move lest he should be discovered, and
immediate death be his lot.</p>

<p>But, alas! the unhappy man was discovered by these hell-hounds,
with this demon at their head, and with cool and deliberate
malice, drew up their muskets to their shoulders and
despatched the unhappy victim, while in the act of imploring
mercy from their hands. His only crime was not being able
to get into the prison without being shot before.</p>

<p>In the yard of No. 7, they found in their hunt another
hapless victim, crouching close along the wall at the far end
of the yard, and fearing to breathe, lest he should share the
fate of his unfortunate countrymen that had already fallen a
sacrifice to the rage of this lawless banditti; when, O! cruel
to relate, five of them drew up the instruments of death, and by
the order of this fell murderer, discharged their contents into
the body of this innocent man, while begging them to spare
his life!</p>

<p>This <i>Nero</i>, now having accomplished his murderous designs,
retired with his troops from the yard, and left it a horrid
scene of his relentless rage!</p>

<p>The dead and the wounded lay scattered about the yard;
seven were killed dead on the spot, and six with the loss of a
leg or an arm, and dangerously wounded; several were pronounced
mortal. The names of every man, either killed or
wounded will be given in the catalogue annexed.</p>

<p>As it was much feared the murderers would endeavor to
conceal many of the dead, Dr. Magrath, head surgeon of the
Hospital, an honest skillful man, entered immediately after
Shortland retired, and exerted his utmost ability in collecting
the dead and wounded from the several prison yards, and conveying
them to the Hospital.</p>

<p>At the same time he sent to the neighboring towns to call
in the aid of medical gentlemen that resided there; he also demanded
admittance into the prisons, which were now closed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
to receive the dead and wounded that had reached the inside
of the prison.</p>

<p>A despatch was immediately sent to Plymouth, to inform the
Admiral and Commodore, and the Commander in Chief of the
Military Department, of the fatal <i>sixth of April, one thousand
eight hundred and fifteen</i>; which day must be of horrid
memory to every American, whose mind will revolt with indignity
at the name of SHORTLAND AND THE MASSACRE
AT DARTMOOR!!</p>

<p><i>Shortland!</i> thou foul monster and inhuman villain! is thy
soul glutted with the blood of the innocent victims, that Fate
had doomed to thy revengeful and blood-thirsty power? I appeal
to the world to say whether the conduct of Warren Hastings,
whether the massacre of St. Domingo, can exceed the
horrid catastrophe of this ill-fated night, conducted under the
immediate inspection of your murderous eye? and should the
laws of your country not doom you to a death of the most severe
nature as a public example for your well known crimes?
Your whole nation is involved as a black accomplice in your
monstrous guilt; and the blood of my unfortunate countrymen,
shed by your base hand, must ever remain a stain to the character
of your nation.</p>

<p>Tell me, <i>ye</i> bloody butchers! and <i>thou</i> who contrived, as
well as ye who executed the execrable design, how dare ye
breathe that air, which wafted to the ear of Majesty the groans
of the wounded and the dying? How dare ye tread that earth
which is wet with the blood of the innocent, shed by your accursed
hands? Do not the goads and stings of conscious guilt
wound you in your daily walks? Do not the ghosts of the
murdered rise before you in your nightly dreams?</p>

<p>On the morning of the seventh, by order of the commander-in-chief
at Plymouth, a Colonel, with a reinforcement of
troops, arrived and took command of the depot. Immediately
on his arrival, he sent notice to the prisoners of his taking the
command, and that Capt. Shortland wished the prisoners to
appoint some few men to receive the explanation of his last
night’s conduct; but we unanimously agreed, and despatched
a letter to the Colonel, acquainting him that as citizens of the
United States of America, we should conceive it a disgrace to
the national character of our country to hold any communication
with the murderer of our fellow-citizens. But provided
the Colonel should require any conference with the prisoners,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
they should at any time with pleasure attend, and explain the
nature of every past event.</p>

<p>The Colonel, requesting a conference, came to the gate attended
by the guilty Shortland, who could not now disguise
the guilt of his crime; he could not look a prisoner in the face;
as he walked along towards the prison bars with his eyes fixed
on the ground, and as he came to the spot where, a few
hours before, lay one of our murdered countrymen, he saw the
blood, and faintly attempted to speak; but the monitor of Heaven
was not quite overcome by the powers of Hell, and he
could not utter a word. After several efforts he hesitatingly
attempted to justify his conduct by saying it was a part of his
duty, which was grounded on the fear he had of the prisoners
making an attempt to escape, and imputed part of the fault to
Mr. Beasley, in driving the prisoners to a state of desperation
by his great delay of sending them home.</p>

<p>The Colonel very patiently heard the stories of both parties,
and promised a jury of inquest should be held over the bodies
of our departed countrymen the next day, and a strict investigation
of every circumstance of the event had, according to
evidence.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock we hoisted the colors half-mast on every
prison; we then visited the Hospital, but the spectacle was
painful indeed, and enough to freeze the blood of the most
hardened parricide; the tables were covered with the amputated
legs and arms of our fellow-prisoners, and our ears stunned
with the groans of forty-two, wounded in the most shocking
manner; and seven lay dead as solemn witnesses of the horrid
act.</p>

<p>We then returned to the prisons and appointed a committee
of ten to take depositions of a great number of persons who
were best acquainted with the particular facts. The committee
being severally sworn, proceeded to make all possible inquiry
into the circumstances of the massacre, and prepare every
testimony to lay before the jury which were to sit over the
bodies the next day.</p>

<p>At two in the afternoon arrived an Admiral and another
officer of high rank in his Majesty’s navy, and after introducing
themselves to the prisoners, in a very friendly and
feeling manner, expressed their extreme regret for the horrid
and barbarous act of Capt. Shortland, and informed us that
they had come clothed with proper authority to make inquiry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
into the conduct of Capt. Shortland in the late unhappy event
and his conduct during his agency at the prison. They assured
us, that he would be called to an account by the government,
and that a fair investigation should be had of all his conduct.</p>

<p>I have omitted to mention a circumstance which occurred
during the dreadful scene of the night. A lamp-lighter, who
was in the act of lighting the lamp at the door of prison No.
3, in which I myself resided, being compelled to take refuge
among the prisoners, was forced by the hurrying group into
the prison. He belonged to the same regiment of soldiers
who were that moment committing these most horrid outrages.
He was immediately seized by the prisoners, and conveyed to
a particular part of the prison, and the prisoners being in the
most enraged state, it was immediately proposed to put him
to death, and sacrifice him to our resentment, as a just retaliation
of our injury; but on cool deliberation and debate throughout
the prison, it was thought better to spare him; and to the
pleasing astonishment of this man, half dead with fear, he was
told to rest easy, for his life should not be taken, but he should
be preserved, that the whole world might distinguish the difference
of humanity between unprovoked British soldiers,
and the injured and provoked American seamen; accordingly,
when the doors were opened to take out the wounded, the man
was released, which astonished and confounded the whole
soldiery, who felt the force of the reproach with the keenest
remorse, and were compelled to express the highest respect
for this generous revenge.</p>

<p>The list of killed and wounded contains all that could be
ascertained at that time, but great suspicions remained among
the prisoners that more had been killed than were certainly
known, as some were missing, and not to be found among the
living or the dead; it was supposed that these had been
killed, and being mangled in a most shocking manner, were
privately taken away by Capt. Shortland, and buried that night,
before Doctor Magrath entered the yard, and a report prevailed
that he had done it: as great numbers who were
slightly wounded did not go to the hospital, I, to ascertain
the exact number of killed and wounded, took the list of
those in the hospital, from the doctor’s books, and every
prison mustered all those that refused going to the hospital,
by which means the list can be depended on as strictly
correct.</p>

<p>At twelve o’clock, at noon, on the eighth, a jury of inquest
arrived, composed of twelve farmers, and a coroner, and sat
over the bodies of our murdered countrymen; they began to
take the depositions of the prisoners and turnkeys, and proceeded
on till seven in the evening, and adjourned till next
morning.</p>

<p>The evidence of the prisoners corresponded with the statement

<p>On the morning of the ninth, the dead not yet being buried,
the jury sat over them again, and proceeded on with the evidence
on both sides, which consisted of Dr. Magrath, whose
evidence was against Shortland, prisoners, turnkeys, soldier-officers,
soldiers, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The summary of the evidence I shall give presently; but
I must here digress a little to give some circumstances that
intervened betwixt the taking of the depositions, and the
verdict of the jury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>This morning an order arrived for the discharge of thirty-four
prisoners, who had applied to be released to man ships
in different parts of Europe.</p>

<p>During the eighth and ninth, the prisoners made every
inquiry in their power to learn whether any were missing,
who were not included among the dead, wounded, or discharged;
but nothing satisfactory could be obtained, but only
a report that after the prisons were closed, Capt. Shortland
had secretly buried some of the most mangled bodies, before
Dr. Magrath entered, as he is a man of integrity, feeling,
candor, firmness, and unshaken veracity, as well as genius
and skill, that no favor or affection could swerve from the
truth. Shortland would therefore endeavor to conceal as
much as possible from him, as whatever came within his
knowledge, came out without fear or reward, and was much
against the conduct of Capt. Shortland. On the morning of
the seventh, as before mentioned, we ascertained by the testimony
of those persons whose names are mentioned in the
certificate to this work, the particulars of the killed and
wounded, whose names have been already mentioned, the
number of which and their situation, were as follows:</p>

<p>Seven were killed dead in the yards, and in the prisons.
Six suffered amputation of a leg or an arm. <i>Thirty-eight</i>
dangerously wounded and many supposed to be mortal by the
surgeon of the depot. <i>Twelve</i> slightly wounded. The total
amount of killed and wounded <i>sixty-three</i>. Among these
were many mangled in the most horrid manner, having
received five, six, and seven wounds apiece from the bayonet.
Hundreds of the prisoners very narrowly escaped, having
received several shots through the hats and clothes.</p>

<p>We have just discovered that the soldiers here at present
are the Somersetshire militia; and the garrison consists of
fifteen hundred soldiers of different military classes.</p>

<p>On the evening of the ninth, the inquest, consisting of
twelve peasants, dependants of Capt. Shortland, delivered in
this most extraordinary and unjust verdict, of Justifiable
Homicide; such a verdict astonished every person, who was
not <i>particeps criminis</i>. This verdict seems to have been
given against evidence; a summary of which on both sides I
shall now proceed to give the reader, that he may judge for
himself. It appeared from the different witnesses before
mentioned, that the hole made in the wall was unknown to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
more than three-fourths of the prisoners confined in the yard
of No. 5 and 7, where the hole was made, and that no combination
had ever been entered into by any of the prisoners
to escape; it was also proved that the prisoners confined in
the yards of No. 1, 3 &amp; 4, were totally ignorant of there being
any hole in the wall. It was proved that the gates were broken
open by a man in the state of intoxication, and unknown to
the prisoners, and that when broken open it was in the
power of the sentry to have taken the offender and confined
him without any resistance of the prisoners. It was also
proved that they came running to the gate out of curiosity, to
learn the occasion of the alarm bells ringing; that the few
persons (who were not above fifty,) flocked into the square,
were carried out of the gates by the numbers pressing in the
rear to gratify their curiosity; that no stones or clubs were
thrown while they were in this situation; that they all immediately
retired into the yards of their respective prisons, and
shut the gates after them; that Capt. Shortland took the immediate
command of the soldiers, and ordered them to fire on
the prisoners; that on firing the prisoners made all possible
exertion to gain the inside of the prison; but some fell
before they could reach it; that the soldiers pursued and
fired into the prisons and killed two within the prison; that
the soldiers on the ramparts singled out the prisoners, and
fired and killed them, as they were going into the prisons;
that after all the prisoners had got in, except some few,
being frightened, and not able to get into the prisons,
ran for refuge close to the walls, and were fired upon
singly, and either killed or wounded by several soldiers firing
at one. That an officer of low rank assisted under the command
of Capt. Shortland, in killing a boy, not over thirteen
years old! that a prisoner applied to Capt. Shortland to
forbear, and stop the horrid massacre, as the prisoners were
retiring as fast as possible, and that Capt. Shortland answered,
“retire, you damned rascal, I’ll hear to nothing.” It was
proved that the turnkeys, contrary to the invariable custom,
had been in and locked all the doors of each prison, except
one; there being four doors to each prison, they had ever
before been left open, till a horn was sounded, and the turnkeys
cried “turn in, turn in;” but that night no horn was
sounded, nor was there any cry to turn in, but the doors
secretly locked, which much surprised the few that happened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
to see the doors locked, but did not suspect any mischief was
about to be done; that this was done some time before the
usual hour for turning in. Also, that Capt. Shortland actually
took hold of a musket with his own hands in conjunction
with a soldier, and fired the first gun. That the soldier-officers
were unwilling to give any orders to the soldiers, or
take any active part in the proceedings.</p>

<p>From the summary of the evidence above given, on the
part of the prisoners, it must appear evident to every impartial
reader, that Capt. Shortland made the attack with malice
prepense. But to give the public the fairest opportunity to
judge, I shall give a summary of the evidence on the part of
Capt. Shortland, which came all from the mouth of witnesses
<i>particeps criminis</i>, and acting with him. Those consisted of
clerks, turnkeys, and soldiers, who had been the very instruments
of the massacre. They deposed and said, that the
prisoners were in a state of mutiny, and that great numbers
had threatened to escape by forcing through the walls, and
that the hole in the wall was big enough for a man to pass
through; that the lock on the gate was broken by some prisoner,
and that stones were thrown while the prisoners were
at the gate, and also clubs and pieces of iron thrown at the
guards by the prisoners while there; that great numbers had
got into the square, and that they did mean to make their
escape. Nothing material could be further drawn from these
witnesses.</p>

<p>In the evening of this day, the bodies of our murdered
countrymen were buried behind the prison walls in the same
manner as before the peace, without form or ceremony, and no
prisoner permitted to attend to see the last sad office, which one
friend can perform for another in giving the grave its due. O!
Britannia, thy boast is gone, thy pride is lost; humanity is fled
from thy degenerate sons, and a safer asylum in the bosom of
the savage tribes is found. Deny the dead their sacred due!</p>

<p>Thou ingrate race, is this the reward due to men who have
labored many years thy faithful servant, and now, after having
dragged out a painful imprisonment for two years, and the
moment the hope of returning had rekindled the sparks of life,
must be massacred in a most barbarous manner, and denied the
right of the grave?</p>

<p>I must here relate one instance which occurred a few years
ago, and which goes very far to show the inhumanity of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
who have had the command of this depot heretofore. In a
manuscript which was left here by the French prisoners,
which I was this evening perusing, I find the following remarkable
circumstance of cruelty related, which took place
during their confinement.</p>

<p>Captain Cotgrave being agent, and Dr. Decker head surgeon
of the hospital, in December, one thousand eight hundred
and nine, a most malignant and contagious disease, bearing the
most frightful and mortal symptoms, broke out among the
French prisoners, which, in the short space of one month, carried
off more than eight hundred.</p>

<p>This unfeeling man, Dr. Decker, caused the coffins to be
brought into the rooms of the hospital to receive the bodies:
where they often remained several days in readiness to receive
the unhappy man fast approaching the end of all his sufferings.</p>

<p>It is said in the manuscript, that this worse than barbarian,
would gaze with the greatest satisfaction on the surrounding
victims, that he might discover from the very inmost recesses
of the heart, what effect the appearance of these coffins had on
their exhausted spirits.</p>

<p>However unfeeling this might be, yet their lot was envied
by hundreds of their countrymen, who were left to perish in
the prison without any assistance, without a friend, and in
want of everything; and would not be received into the Hospital
by this unfeeling man.</p>

<p>Their extreme sufferings would have moved the heart even
of a cannibal, and it is a solitary instance of cruelty, that any
one belonging to a civilized nation could rejoice at such a
mournful spectacle, and exult over their fellow-beings in the
agonies of death, as did this man often, in saying the more deaths
the fewer enemies.</p>

<p>Another circumstance is related in the same manuscript, in
which Capt. Isaac Cotgrave was the principal actor.</p>

<p>On the eighth of October, one thousand eight hundred and
nine, the turnkeys, by mistake, had left one of the prison doors
unlocked, which being discovered by some of the prisoners, they
determined, if possible, to effect an escape; they got into the yard
but, unfortunately, were discovered the very moment they came
out, by one of the sentries, who gave the alarm, and instantly
a volley of sixty muskets was discharged at them; numbers
were wounded, but none killed; they then hastily retired into
the prison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>Capt. Cotgrave, the agent, then entered the yard at the head
of a large body of troops, and after searching the yard in every
direction, and discovering nobody he was retiring, when they
discovered a man creeping along the wall; the blood-thirsty
monsters instantly fell upon the unhappy victim, and would
neither listen to his cries nor prayers, but before he could make
himself known to them, several musket-balls had pierced his
vital parts, and laid him lifeless on the ground; but they were
not content with this; they ran up to him, and ran over and over
his lifeless corpse, stabbing it with their bayonets in many
places; after having satiated their ferocity, on inspecting the
body, they found it to be one of their own men, whom the darkness
of the night had prevented them from distinguishing.</p>

<p>In memory of this horrid act, the French prisoners raised a
monument on the very spot where it was committed; but the
keepers of the prison had it destroyed the same day, for it was a
monument of their cruelty.</p>


<p class="ph3">THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF
PRISONERS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We, the undersigned, being each severally sworn on the
holy evangelists of the Almighty God, for the investigation of
the circumstances attending the late horrid massacre, and
having heard the depositions of a great number of witnesses,
from our own personal knowledge, and from the depositions
given in as aforesaid,</p>


<p class="ph4"><span class="smcap">Report as Follows</span>:</p>

<p>That on the 6th of April, about six o’clock in the evening,
when the prisoners were all quiet in their respective yards,
it being about the usual time of turning in for the night, and
the greater part of the prisoners being then in the prisons, the
alarm bell was rung, and many of the prisoners ran up to the
Market-square to learn the occasion of the alarm. There
were then drawn up in the Square several hundred soldiers,
with Captain Shortland [the Agent] at their head; it was likewise
observed, at the same time, that additional numbers of
soldiers were posting themselves on the walls round the prison
yards. One of them observed to the prisoners, that they had
better go into the prisons, for they would be charged upon directly.
This, of course, occasioned considerable alarm among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
them. In this moment of uncertainty, they were running in
different directions, inquiring the cause of the alarm—some
toward their respective prisons, and some toward the Market-square.
When about one hundred were collected in the
Square, Captain Shortland ordered the soldiers to charge upon
them, which order the soldiers were reluctant in obeying, as
the prisoners were using no violence; but on the order being
repeated, they made a charge, and the prisoners retreated out
of the Square into the prison-yards, and shut the gates after
them. Captain Shortland himself opened the gates, and ordered
the soldiers to fire in among the prisoners, who were all
retreating in different directions toward their respective prisons.
It appears there was some hesitation in the minds of
the officers, whether or not it was proper to fire upon the
prisoners in that situation; on which Shortland seized a musket
out of the hands of a soldier, which he fired. Immediately
after, the fire became general, and many of the prisoners were
either killed or wounded. The remainder were endeavoring
to get into the prisons, when going towards the lower doors,
the soldiers on the walls commenced firing on them from that
quarter, which killed some and wounded others. After much
difficulty, [all the doors being closed in the entrance, but one
in each prison] the survivors succeeded in gaining the prisons;
immediately after which, parties of soldiers came to the doors
of Nos. 3 and 4 prisons, and fired several vollies into them
through the windows and doors, which killed one man in each
prison, and severely wounded others.</p>

<p>It likewise appears, that the preceding butchery was followed
up with a disposition of peculiar inveteracy and barbarity.</p>

<p>One man, who was severely wounded in No. 7 prison-yard,
and being unable to make his way to the prison, was
come up with by the soldiers, whom he implored for mercy,
but in vain; five of the hardened wretches immediately levelled
their pieces at him, and shot him dead on the spot.—The
soldiers who were posted on the walls, manifested equal cruelty,
by keeping up a constant fire on every prisoner they
could see in the yards endeavoring to get into the prison, when
their numbers were very few, and when not the least shadow
of resistance could be made or expected. Several of them
had got into No. 6 prison cook-house, which was pointed out
by the soldiers on the walls, to those who were marching in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
from the Square; they immediately went up and fired into the
same, which wounded several; one of the prisoners ran out
with the intention of gaining his prison, but was killed before
he reached the door.</p>

<p>On an impartial consideration of the circumstances of
the case, we are induced to believe that it was a premeditated
scheme in the mind of Captain Shortland,
for reasons which we will now proceed to give—as an illucidation
of its origin, we will recur back to an event which
happened some days previous. Captain Shortland was, at the
time, absent at Plymouth, but before going, he ordered the
contractor or his clerk to serve out one pound of indifferent
hard bread, instead of one pound and a half of soft bread,
their usual allowance—this the prisoners refused to receive—they
waited all day in expectation of their usual allowance
being served out; but at senset, finding this would not be the
case, burst open the lower gates, and went up to the store,
demanding to have their bread.</p>

<p>The officers of the garrison, on being alarmed, and informed
of their proceedings, observed, that it was no more
than right the prisoners should have their usual allowance,
and strongly reprobated the conduct of Captain Shortland in
withholding it from them. They were accordingly served
with their bread, and quietly returned to their prison. This
circumstance, with the censures that were thrown on his conduct,
reached the ears of Shortland on his return home, and
he must then have determined on the diabolical plan of seizing
the first slight pretext to turn in the military, to butcher the
prisoners for the gratification of his malice and revenge. It
unfortunately happened, that in the afternoon of the 6th of
April, some boys who were playing ball in No. 7 yard,
knocked their ball over into the barrack-yard, and on the sentry
in that yard refusing to throw it back to them, they picked
a hole in the wall to get in after it.</p>

<p>This afforded Shortland his wished-for pretext, and he took
his measures accordingly; he had all the garrison drawn up
in the military walk, additional numbers posted on the walls,
and every thing ready prepared before the alarm bell was
rung; this, he naturally concluded, would draw the attention
of a great number of prisoners towards the gates, to learn the
cause of the alarm, while the turnkeys were despatched into
the yards to lock all the doors but one of each prison, to prevent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
the prisoners retreating out of the way before he had sufficiently
wreaked his vengeance.</p>

<p>What adds peculiar weight to the belief of its being a premeditated,
determined massacre, are,</p>

<p><i>First.</i>—The sanguinary disposition manifested on every occasion
by Shortland, he having, prior to this time, ordered
the soldiers to fire into the prisons, through the prison windows,
upon unarmed prisoners asleep in their hammocks, on
account of a light being seen in the prisons; which barbarous
act was repeated several nights successively. That murder
was not then committed, was owing to an over-ruling Providence
alone; for the balls were picked up in the prison,
where they passed through the hammocks of men then asleep
in them. He having also ordered the soldiers to fire upon
the prisoners in the yard of No. 7 prison, because they
would not deliver up to him a man who had escaped from the
<i>cachot</i>, which order the commanding officer of the soldiers refused
to obey; and generally, he having seized on every
slight pretext to injure the prisoners, by stopping their marketing
for ten days repeatedly, and once a third part of their
provisions for the same length of time.</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i>—He having been heard to say, when the boys
had picked the hole in the wall, and some time before the
alarm bell rung, while all the prisoners were quiet as usual
in their respective yards, “<i>I’ll fix the damn’d rascals directly</i>.”</p>

<p><i>Thirdly.</i>—His having all the soldiers on their posts, and the
garrison fully prepared before the alarm bell rung. It could
not then, of course, be rung to assemble the soldiers, but to
alarm the prisoners, and create confusion among them.</p>

<p><i>Fourthly.</i>—The soldiers upon the wall, previous to the alarm
bell being rung, informing the prisoners that they would be
charged upon directly.</p>

<p><i>Fifthly.</i>—The turnkeys going into the yards and closing all
the doors but one in each prison, while the attention of the
prisoners was attracted by the alarm bell. This was done
about fifteen minutes sooner than usual, and without informing
the prisoners it was time to shut up. It was ever the invariable
practice of the turnkeys, from which they never deviated
before that night, when coming into the yard to shut
up, to hollow to the prisoners so loud as to be heard throughout
the yards, “<i>turn in, turn in!</i>” but, on that night, it was
done so secretly, that not one man in a hundred knew they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
were shut; and in particular their shutting the door of No.
7 prison, which the prisoners usually went in and out at,
[and which was formerly always closed last] and leaving one
open in the other end of the prison, which was exposed to a
cross-fire from the soldiers on the walls, and which the prisoners
had to pass in gaining the prisons.</p>

<p>We here solemnly aver, that there was no preconcerted
plan to attempt breaking out. There cannot be produced the
least shadow of a reason or inducement for that intention, the
prisoners daily expecting to be released, and to embark on
board cartels for their native country. And we likewise
solemnly assert, that there was no intention of resisting, in
any manner, the authority of this depot.</p>

<p>N. B. Seven were killed, thirty dangerously wounded,
and thirty slightly so. Total, sixty-seven killed and wounded.</p>

</div>

<p>The same day Mr. Ingraham come to the prison and informed
the prisoners that he had come for the purpose of shipping a
number of men, to man ships now lying in different ports in
Europe; he also informed us that he had been appointed agent,
under the consular agent of the United States: and that every
preparation was making for the immediate release of every
prisoner, and we might be assured of the immediate arrival of
the ships from London to convey us to the United States.</p>

<p>On the tenth, a number were discharged to man different ships
in Europe; this day arrangements were made by the prisoners,
for the assistance and relief of our wounded countrymen in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
Hospital, and also an arrangement for the prisoners to wear
crape on their arm for thirty days after their arrival in America,
as a tribute of respect due to their departed friends and fellow-prisoners.
The wounded in the hospital were paid every attention,
for their comfort and speedy recovery, by Doctor Magrath.</p>

<p>We received no letters from Mr. Beasley, although hundreds
of letters had been sent to him since the melancholy event of the
6th. Reports were circulating that a new agent was to be appointed
by the United States to supersede Mr. Beasley, which
every man most anxiously wished might be true, but had not the
satisfaction to learn it was the case; every day’s delay made
more confusion and anxiety among the prisoners. The weather
during this month up to the present day, had been remarkably
fine, pure and healthy, and more so than it had been at this
place since our confinement; as if the All-Seeing Eye of Heaven
looked down with pity and compassion upon our injured
and wounded countrymen, and dispensed His blessings for their
speedy recovery in the salubrity of His air. That passage in
Holy Writ, in this instance, seemed to be remarkably verified:
“that when the prisoner was sick in prison, He visited him.”</p>

<p>Capt. Shortland, after being acquitted, resumed the command
of the depot, but he was seldom seen by the prisoners, being very
apprehensive that the prisoners would shoot him the first opportunity;
therefore he kept a body guard around him, and this
day a draft of thirty prisoners being discharged, and having to
pass by his house, he had his guard stationed at his door.</p>

<p>On the morning of the twelfth, we were informed by Capt.
Shortland that the drafts for the discharge of the prisoners were
already made out, and that the draft for the first cartel would
consist of 280, to be discharged as they entered this depot. I
therefore obtained the exact number of prisoners then in each
prison, which I shall give as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>In visiting the hospitals, I found the wounded prisoners fast
recovering, all in high spirits, the prison generally more healthy
than it had been since our arrival in it. Capt. Shortland removed
his family from this place, for his guilt had brought upon
him the apprehension of the first draught’s retaliating upon
him by attacking his family; but no such idea had entered the
imagination of any prisoner; it was the creature of his own
guilt.</p>

<p>We were ordered at this time to be in readiness to deliver up
every article which we had received from the British Government;
such as beds, hammocks, blankets, &amp;c., &amp;c. These articles
had been in our possession, and in constant use ever since
the second of April, 1813, and had never been changed; we felt
but little reluctance in delivering them up, when animated with
the idea of once more visiting our native country, and leaving a
dreary prison, which many of us had inhabited for upwards of
two years.</p>

<p>On the following day we received a London paper which
contained the following account of the late horid massacre at this
depot; it read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An affair of a serious nature has recently taken place at
Dartmoor prison: the prisoners attaching the greater part of the
fault of their long detention since the peace, to Mr. Beasley
their country’s agent, resident at London, had, before the affray,
burnt his person in effigy in the yard of their prison; on account
of which, Captain Shortland, unarmed and unattended,
entered the yard of their prison with a view to appease the anger
of these unfortunate men; but his reception was attended
with the prisoners discharging a pistol at him, the contents of
which grazed his clerk; upon this the prisoners attempted to
gain their liberty by rushing out of the gates, but were soon
coiled by the guards firing upon them, and killing twelve, and
wounding thirty.</p>
</div>

<p>The account was equally base and false, as the act was cruel
and murderous; but the mention of twelve killed confirmed the
prisoners in their belief that this number had been killed, and
the five which were not to be found, were secretly buried by
Captain Shortland that night, and that he, in the guilty and confused
state of his mind, had given an account of twelve instead
of seven, which were the only ones found of the killed. I leave
it to the reader to judge whether nature or habit had done most
towards hardening the feelings of this man. It is well known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
that men accustomed to the sufferings and misery of their fellow-beings,
soon grow hardened and forget them. But could
this man from the short time here, have grown so callous in his
feelings as to commit such acts from habit, or must cruelty and
malice have been woven in his constitution?</p>

<p>On this day, the prisoners in making preparation for their
departure, prepared a large white flag, and as a memento had
in the middle of it, the representation of a tomb, with the Goddess
of Liberty leaning on it, and a murdered sailor lying by
its side, and an inscription over it in large capital letters,
“<i>Columbia weeps, and we remember</i>.” This flag was intended
to be carried home to the United States, as it showed a just
resentment for the execrable deeds which it recorded, and a
just respect for the sufferers. This same day, numbers of
prisoners were released by application of their friends in England,
for the purpose of manning ships in different ports. We
had no news from Mr. Beasley, and most of the prisoners
barefooted, the oldest in a state of nudity, not having received
any jackets or trowsers for more than eleven months.</p>

<p>At length, when we were almost dead with impatience and
delay, on the fourteenth we received a letter from Mr. Beasley
to the following effect:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Fellow Citizens,<br>
</p>

<p>I have been informed that numbers of the prisoners have
entertained an idea that they are to remain in prison, until
the arrival of some United States’ ships in this country; but
I can assure them that there is no foundation for the belief;
and I can assure them of eight cartels being already taken up
for their conveyance to the United States. And with regret I
hear from officers who were sent to inquire into the shameful
conduct of the sixth of April, that the extravagant excess of the
prisoners was partly occasioned by their censuring the United
States and myself.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Beasley had, no doubt, been informed of what he wrote,
but it was not the fact, for his information, no doubt, came
from the two officers who were here, the Admiral and his associate;
but no such conversation took place in their hearing,
which numbers of the most respectable prisoners can testify,
and no such idea had been entertained by any prisoner in the
prison. These officers intended that Mr. Beasley should bear
all the blame. God knows his conduct was blameable enough
throughout; but to do him justice he had no blame in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
murderous act of the fatal sixth of April. His effigy had been
burnt on the 24th of March, and all animosity had been dissipated
with the ashes of his effigy, and his name seemed to be
forgotten, for it was scarcely ever mentioned. Mr. Beasley
had had every particular of the event before his interview with
the officers, but made no exertions as yet to inquire into the
affray.</p>

<p>The weather up to this day since the month began, had
been remarkably fine for this place, but this morning the
moor, as far as the eye could reach, was covered with snow,
and continued to snow all day, and the weather very cold.</p>

<p>On the sixteenth we received letters from London, from
many of our fellow-citizens, who had received passports and
left the prison since the fatal sixth of April; on their arrival
in London, they were taken before the lord mayor of that
city, and their depositions taken relative to the massacre of
the sixth, which was to the same purport as before the committee.
On the same day, Col. Hawker, formerly consular
agent, under the American consul at London, visited the
prison for the purpose of shipping seamen to man ships at
Plymouth, bound to New-Orleans. In this way the prisoners
were daily diminishing in number, as any one might obtain a
passport who could procure a friend to make application for
their release, and informing Mr. Beasley that they required
no assistance from him to convey them to the United States.
In obtaining a passport in this way from Capt. Shortland,
they needed no other protection in this country.</p>

<p>This day a man was committed to the cachot for drawing
money from Col. Hawker in an assumed name. The colonel
was determined to have him brought to condign punishment:
this man the next day was taken out of the cachot and conveyed
to Exeter, to be tried at the next August assizes.</p>

<p>On visiting the hospital, I found the wounded and the sick
fast recovering, and had every attention paid them by Dr.
Magrath, for their health and comfort, that his resources
would allow.</p>

<p>On the seventeenth, a black man belonging to No. 4 was
found dead in his hammock. On this day we received
another letter from Mr. Beasley, which informed us that
those officers who had visited the prison by order of the
British government, had represented the conduct of the prisoners
on the sixth of April, in a very unfavorable light, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
having received a correct statement from the prison, and a
general summary of the evidence on both sides as delivered
in to the jury of inquest; he now apologized for his last
letter.</p>

<p>On the nineteenth, at four o’clock in the afternoon, an
express arrived informing Capt. Shortland that one cartel had
arrived at Plymouth, and ordered him immediately to remove
two hundred and forty-nine prisoners from this depot to that
place, for embarking on board the ship. At five in the afternoon,
the whole draft was collected in the square, with all
their baggage. This was the first draft of prisoners that had
entered the prison after the declaration of war, and had been
immured within these gloomy walls more than two long and
tedious years. They were then informed that one baggage
wagon would be allowed to every hundred men, for the convenience
of their baggage to Plymouth.</p>

<p>The prisoners being the greater part barefooted, made
inquiry whether any arrangement had been made by Mr.
Beasley for providing them with shoes and clothes, as they
were much in want of them; but were much surprised and
disappointed when they found no provision had been made.
The money due from government had run over the usual
time of payment, now twenty-five days, although application
had previously been made for the payment of the daily allowance,
and also, the other articles, both by the prisoners and
Capt. Shortland himself; but Mr. Beasley still neglected to
make any arrangement for either.</p>

<p>At six every prisoner’s name was called, and they committed
together with their baggage to a separate prison, ready
for their departure the next morning. The joy they felt on
this occasion is better imagined than described; I therefore
leave to the imagination of the reader, what emotions the
heart must feel, when a change which promised every endearment
of life to them, and freed them from every evil of it,
was about to take place.</p>

<p>I visited the hospital this evening for the last time, and had
the pleasing satisfaction of finding the sick and wounded in a
state of fast recovery, except a few who were dangerous.</p>

<p>The next morning we took our departure for Plymouth,
and with joy in our hearts bid farewell to that pale of misery,
and at four in the afternoon arrived at Plymouth, having
travelled all the way under the direction of a strong guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>We were immediately embarked on board the cartel Maria
Christiana, a Swedish ship, commanded by Capt. Dirkes; we
found some few of our countrymen who had been on parole,
on board the ship.</p>

<p>It was now just forty days since the arrival of the ratified
treaty in England.</p>

<p>The next day eight of the prisoners left the cartel to join a
brig under French colors bound for France.</p>

<p>On the twenty-second the wind being contrary, the prisoners
were permitted to go on shore and spend the day. A
court of inquiry had been instituted by commissioners appointed
by both governments, for the investigation of the
unfortunate occurrences of the sixth of April, and was then
sitting for that purpose. Several of the prisoners were called
upon to give evidence in the cause, and their depositions
taken by the court that day.</p>

<p>The court was attended by Mr. Williams, deputy consular
agent to Mr. Beasley.</p>

<p>Before we set sail Mr. Williams informed us that he was
instructed by Mr. Beasley to take down all the particulars of
the investigation, for the purpose of laying them before the
American government; but the commissioners had not reported
when we left Plymouth, but it was expected they
would in a few days, which shall constitute a part of this
work as soon as it is received.</p>

<p>Mr. Williams informed us that the money allowed by
government, which had been due thirty days, would not be
paid by Mr. Beasley, nor would any provision be made by
him for shoes or clothing, but that the prisoners must go
home as they were.</p>

<p>On the twenty-third, the wind being favorable, we hove
short, and made preparations for sailing.</p>

<p>On mustering the prisoners, we found their number
amounted to two hundred and sixty-three; this increase of
number was by officers paroled at Ashburton.</p>

<p>At three in the afternoon we left the port of Plymouth,
with a fresh and favorable wind.</p>

<p>We had left behind at Dartmoor five thousand one hundred
and ninety-three of our fellow prisoners, whom the agent informed
us would be conveyed to this place in the same
manner as ourselves in a few days, as the other cartels were
on their way round to Plymouth, and thence to embark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
immediately for the United States. After leaving Plymouth
we found the provisions under the direction of Capt. Turner,
appointed by the agents to deal out the rations to the prisoners.</p>

<p>We were allowed, five days in the week, one pound of salt
beef, one pound of bread, half a pound of potatoes a day;
the other two days one pound of pork, the same quantity of
bread, and half a pint of peas per man, and half a pint of
vinegar a week.</p>

<p>Mr. Beasley had made arrangements for each prisoner to
have a small bed and blanket; the cartel was equipped
according to custom, with great guns and small arms.</p>

<p>A Physician had been appointed with a sufficient quantity
of medicine to serve during the passage.</p>

<p>One part of the ship was allotted to the sick, where every
attention was paid them by their countrymen for their comfort
and convenience.</p>

<p>During the residue of the month nothing material occurred;
cartel quite healthy, only five cases of sick, and them not
very dangerous; the month ended with winds, light and
unfavorable.</p>

<p>On the first of May we were in lat. 45&#176; North, and longitude
23&#176; 41’ West. On the second, being in long. 24&#176;, we
spoke a brig from London bound to Quebec.</p>

<p>From the first to the fourteenth the winds were from N. W.
to S. W., and the cartel kept between the latitudes of 42&#176; and
44&#176; North.</p>

<p>Some few sick but not dangerously. On this day we discovered
a sail on our weather beam, standing to the eastward;
at 2 P. M. she bore up and stood for the cartel, with a
British flag flying; at four we spoke her in lat. 42, and long.
38. She proved to be a British transport with a number of
troops from Mobile, bound to England, and fourteen days
from Bermuda. She sent her boat alongside of the cartel
with a naval and military officer, and the captain of the transport;
they came on board the cartel and remained for an
hour, and then returned to the transport, and each ship made
sail for their destined places.</p>

<p>The winds still continued the same way the twenty-eighth.
This day, Sunday, we fell in with several large islands of Ice,
lat. 43&#176;; on the same day, lat. 42&#176; long. 60&#176;, we spoke the
brig Sally Barker, six days from Boston, bound for Portugal;
the three days following the winds continuing light, from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
South and West, we spoke a brig from Portland four days
out, bound to Surinam.</p>

<p>Cartel perfectly healthy, with the exception of one man
very low in a consumption.</p>

<p>On the first of June, lat. 40, 50, long. 64, spoke the ship
Helvitius, of Philadelphia, bound home, after remaining during
the whole war up the east country. On the 2nd of June, lat.
40, 35, long. 69, the majority of the prisoners agreed to take
possession of the cartel, and run her into New-York, for the
following reasons: the ship being disabled by the loss of her
main trussel-trees, which endangered the top-mast, and rendered
her unfit for sea; secondly, there being every appearance
of a gale from the S. W. and the weather thick and
hazy; thirdly, the port of New-York being the most convenient
for the greater part of the prisoners; for which
reasons, at twelve meridian, by the general voice of all on
board, the command was taken from her former captain, and
she directed for the port of New-York. At 4 P. M. the man
in a consumption “put off this mortal coil,” and took his
quietus in thirty-five fathoms of water, in the usual form
at sea.</p>

<p>The captain of the ship required some document, that he
might show for his indemnification for resigning the command
of the ship, and deviating from his destined port, which
was Norfolk, Vir.; the following certificate, signed by a
great number of the prisoners, was delivered him.</p>


<p class="ph4">CERTIFICATE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We, the undersigned, citizens of the United States of
America, do hereby certify, that on the second day of June,
1815, at twelve meridian, being in lat. 40, 30, long. 69, 30,
by mutual agreement of a majority of prisoners now on
board the cartel Maria Christiana, bound for Norfolk, did
take possession of her, and directed her for the port of New-York.</p>
</div>

<p>At four o’clock on the third, we discovered the highland
of New-Jersey bearing W. by S.; at eight made the light
house, distance three or four leagues; at two P. M. obtained
a pilot and stood within the Hook; at seven came to an
anchor; the next morning arrived at New-York.</p>

<p>Having received the report of the commissioners since our
arrival in the United States, we shall give it to the reader<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
verbatim. The reader will perceive that it differs somewhat
from the account of the massacre which I have given before,
and that of the committee of prisoners. The public are to
judge of the report; the facts seemed not to warrant just such
an one; but to give my simple opinion as an individual, I
believe that the commissioners, through a sort of <i>pia fraus</i>
for the love of peace and harmony between the two governments,
have made it a vail of amnesty, and a preventative of
new troubles.</p>


<p class="ph3">THE REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONERS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="author">
<span class="smcap">Plymouth</span>, 26th April, 1815.<br>
</p>

<p>We, the undersigned commissioners, appointed on behalf of
our respective governments, to inquire into, and report upon,
the unfortunate occurrence of the 6th of April instant, at Dartmoor
prison, having carefully perused the proceedings of the
several courts of inquiry instituted immediately after that
event, by the orders of Admiral Sir John T. Duckworth and
Major General Brown respectively, as well as the depositions
taken at the coroner’s inquest upon the bodies of the prisoners
who lost their lives upon that melancholy occasion; upon
which inquest the jury found a verdict of justifiable homicide;
proceed immediately to the examination upon oath, in the presence
of one or more of the magistrates of the vicinity, of all
the witnesses, both American and English, who offered themselves
for that purpose, or who could be discovered as likely
to afford any material information upon the subject, as well
as those who had been previously examined before the coroner,
or otherwise, to the number in the whole of about eighty.
We further proceed to a minute examination of the prisons, for
the purpose of clearing up some points, which upon the evidence
alone, were scarcely intelligible; obtaining from the
prisoners, and from the officers of the depot, all the necessary
assistance and explanation; and premising, that we have been
from necessity compelled to draw many of our conclusions
from statements and evidence highly contradictory, we do
now make upon the whole proceedings the following report:</p>

<p>During the period which has elapsed since the arrival in
this country of the account of the ratification of the treaty of
Ghent, an increased degree of restlessness and impatience of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
confinement appears to have prevailed amongst the American
prisoners at Dartmoor, which, though not exhibited in the
shape of any violent excess, has been principally indicated by
threats of breaking out if not soon released.</p>

<p>On the fourth of this month in particular, only two days
previous to the events, the subject of this inquiry, a large body
of the prisoners rushed into the market-square, from whence,
by the regulations of the prison, they are excluded, demanding
bread, instead of bircuit, which had on that day been issued
by the officers of the depot; their demands, however,
having been then almost immediately complied with, they returned
to their own yards, and the employment of force on
that occasion became unnecessary.</p>

<p>On the evening of the sixth, about six o’clock, it was clearly
proved to us, that a breach had been made in one of the
prison walls, sufficient for a full-sized man to pass, and that
others had been commenced in the course of the day near the
same spot, though never completed.</p>

<p>That a number of the prisoners were over the railing
erected to prevent them from communicating with the sentinels
on the walls, which was of course forbidden by the regulations
of the prison, and that in the space between the railing
and those walls, they were tearing up pieces of turf, and
wantonly pelting each other in a noisy and disorderly
manner.</p>

<p>That a much more considerable number of the prisoners
was collected together at that time in one of their yards near
the place where the breach was effected, and that although
such collection of prisoners was not unusual at other times
(the gambling tables being commonly kept in that part of the
yard) yet, when connected with the circumstances of the
breach, and the time of the day, which was after the hour the
signal for the prisoners to their respective prisons had ceased
to sound, it became a natural and just ground of alarm to
those who had charge of the depot.</p>

<p>It was also in evidence that in the building formerly the
petty officers’ prison, but now the guard barrack, which
stands in the yard to which the hole in the wall would serve
as a communication, a part of the arms of the guard who
were off duty, were usually kept in the racks, and though
there was no evidence that this was in any respect the motive
which induced the prisoners to make the opening in the wall,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
or even that they were ever acquainted with the fact, it naturally
became at least a further cause of suspicion and alarm,
and an additional reason for precaution.</p>

<p>Upon these grounds, Captain Shortland appears to us to
have been justified in giving the order, which about this time
he seems to have given, to sound the alarm-bell, the usual
signal for collecting the officers of the depot, and putting the
military on the alert.</p>

<p>However reasonable and justifiable this was as a measure
of precaution, the effects produced thereby in the prisons,
but which could not have been intended, were most unfortunate,
and deeply to be regretted. A considerable number of
the prisoners in the yards, where no disturbances existed
before, and who were either already within their respective
prisons, or quietly retiring as usual towards them, immediately
upon the sound of the bell rushed back from curiosity
(as it appears) towards the gates, where, by that time, the
crowd had assembled, and many who were at the time absent
from their yards, were also, from the plan of the prison, compelled,
in order to reach their own homes, to pass by the
same spot, and thus, that which was merely a measure of precaution,
in its operation increased the evil it was intended to
prevent.</p>

<p>Almost at the same instant that the alarm-bell rang, (but
whether before or subsequent, is, upon the evidence, doubtful,
though Captain Shortland states it positively, as one of his
further reasons for causing it to ring) some one or more of
the prisoners broke the iron chain, which was the only fastening
of No. 1 gate, leading into the market-square, by means
of an iron bar; and a very considerable number of the prisoners
immediately rushed towards that gate; and many of
them began to press forwards as fast as the opening would
permit, into the square.</p>

<p>There was no direct proof before us of previous concert or
preparation on the part of the prisoners; and no evidence of
their intention or disposition to effect their escape on this occasion,
excepting that which arose by inference from the whole
of the above detailed circumstances connected together.</p>

<p>The natural and almost irresistible inference to be drawn,
however, from the conduct of the prisoners by Captain Shortland
and the military, was, that an intention on the part of the
prisoners to escape was on the point of being carried into execution,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
and it was at least certain that they were by force passing
beyond the limits prescribed to them, at a time when they
ought to have been quietly going in for the night. It was also
in evidence that the outer gates of the market-square were
usually opened about this time to let the bread-wagon pass
and repass to the store, although at the period in question they
were in fact closed.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, and with these impressions necessarily
operating upon his mind, and a knowledge that if the
prisoners once penetrated through the square, the power of
escape was almost to a certainty afforded to them, if they
should be so disposed. Capt. Shortland, in the first instance,
proceeded down the square towards the prisoners, having ordered
a part of the different guards, to the number of about
fifty only at first, (though they were increased afterwards,) to
follow him. For some time both he and Dr. Magrath endeavored
by quiet means and persuasion, to induce the prisoners
to retire to their own yards, explaining to them the fatal
consequences which must ensue if they refused, as the military
would in that case be necessarily compelled to employ force.
The guard was by this time formed in the rear of Capt. Shortland,
about two thirds of the way down the square—the latter
is about one hundred feet broad, and the guard extended nearly
all across. Captain Shortland, finding that persuasion was
all in vain, and that although some were induced by it to make
an effort to retire, others pressed on in considerable numbers,
at last ordered about 15 file of the guard, nearly in front of the
gate which had been forced, to charge the prisoners back to
their own yards. The prisoners were in some places so near
the military, that one of the soldiers states he could not come
fairly down to the charge; and the military were unwilling to
act as against an enemy. Some of the prisoners also were
unwilling and reluctant to retire, and some pushing and struggling
ensued between the parties, arising partly from intention,
but mainly from the pressure of those behind preventing those
in front from getting back. After some little time, however,
this charge appears to have been so far effective, and that with
little or no injury to the prisoners, as to have driven them for
the most part quite down out of the square, with the exception
of a small number who continued their resistance about No. 1
gate. A great crowd still remained collected after this in the
passage between the square and the prisoners’ yards, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
the part of these yards in the vicinity of the gates. This assemblage
still refused to withdraw, and according to most of
the English witnesses, and some of the American, was making
a noise, hallooing, insulting and provoking, and daring the
military to fire, and, according to the evidence of some of the
soldiers, and some others, was pelting the military with large
stones, by which some of them were actually struck. This
circumstance is, however, denied by many of the American
witnesses; and some of the English, upon having the question
put to them, stated they saw no stones thrown previously to
the firing, although their situation at the time was such as to
enable them to see most of the other proceedings in the square.
Under these circumstances the firing commenced. With regard
to any order having been given to fire, the evidence is
very contradictory. Several of the Americans swear positively
that Capt. Shortland gave that order; but the manner in
which, from the confusion of the moment, they describe this
part of the transaction, is so different in its details, that it is
very difficult to reconcile their testimony. Many of the soldiers
and other English witnesses heard the word given by
some one, but no one of them can swear it was by Capt. Shortland,
or by any one in particular, and some, amongst whom is
the officer commanding the guard, think, if Capt. Shortland
had given such an order, that they must have heard it, which
they did not. In addition to this, Capt. Shortland denies the
fact; and from the situation in which he appears to have been
placed at the time, even according to the American witnesses,
in front of the soldiers, it may appear somewhat improbable
that he should then have given such an order. But, however,
it may remain a matter of doubt whether the firing first began
in the square by order, or was a spontaneous act of the soldiers
themselves, it seemed clear that it was continued and renewed
both there and elsewhere, without orders; and that on the platforms,
and in several places about the prison, it was certainly
commenced without any authority. The fact of an order having
been given at first, provided the firing was, under the existing
circumstances, justifiable, does not appear very material
in any other point of view than as showing a want of self-possession
and discipline in the troops, if they should have fired
without order. With regard to the above most important consideration,
of whether the firing was justifiable or not, we are
of opinion, under all the circumstances of the case, from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
apprehension which the soldiers might fairly entertain, owing
to the numbers and conduct of the prisoners, that this firing to
a certain extent, was justifiable in a military point of view, in
order to intimidate the prisoners, and compel them thereby to desist
from all acts of violence, and to retire as they were ordered,
from a situation in which the responsibility of the agents, and
the military, could not permit them with safety to remain.—From
the fact of the crowd being so close, and the firing at
first being attended with very little injury, it appears probable
that a large proportion of the muskets were, as stated by one
or two of the witnesses, levelled over the heads of the prisoners;
a circumstance in some respects to be lamented, as it
induced them to cry out “blank cartridges,” and merely irritated
and encouraged them to renew their insults to the
soldiery, which produced a repetition of the firing in a manner
much more destructive. The firing in the square having
continued for some time, by which several of the prisoners
sustained injuries, the greater part of them appear to have
been running back with the utmost precipitation and confusion
to their respective prisons, and the cause for further firing
seems at this period to have ceased. It appears accordingly
that Capt. Shortland was in the market-square, exerting himself
and giving orders to that effect, and that Lieut. Fortye
had succeeded in stopping the fire of his part of the guard.
Under these circumstances, it is very difficult to find any justification
for the further continuance and renewal of the firing,
which certainly took place both in the prison yards and elsewhere;
though we have some evidence of subsequent provocation
given to the military, and resistance to the turnkeys
in shutting the prisons, and of stones being thrown out from
within the prison doors. The subsequent firing rather appears
to have arisen from the state of individual irritation and
exasperation on the part of the soldiers who followed the prisoners
into their yards, and from the absence of nearly all the
officers, who might have restrained it; as well as from the
great difficulty of putting an end to a firing when once commenced
under such circumstances. Capt. Shortland was from
this time busily occupied with the turnkeys in the square, receiving
and taking care of the wounded. Ensign White
remained with his guard at the breach, and Lieuts. Avelyne
and Fortye, the only other subalterns known to have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
present, continued in the square with the main bodies of their
respective guards.</p>

<p>The time of the day, which was the officers’ dinner hour,
will, in some measure, explain this, as it caused the absence
of every officer from the prison whose presence was not indispensable
there. And this circumstance, which has been
urged as an argument to prove the intention of the prisoners
to take this opportunity to escape, tended to increase the confusion,
and to prevent those great exertions being made,
which might perhaps have obviated a portion, at least, of the
mischief which ensued.</p>

<p>At the same time that the firing was going on in the
square, a cross fire was also kept up from several of the platforms
on the walls round the prison where the sentries stand,
by straggling parties of soldiers who ran up there for that
purpose. As far as this fire was directed to disperse the men
assembled round the breach, for which purpose it was most
effectual, it seems to stand upon the same ground as that in
the first instance in the square. But that part, which it is
positively sworn was directed against struggling parties of
prisoners running about the yards and endeavoring to enter
in the few doors which the turnkeys, according to their usual
practice, had left open, does seem, as stated, to have been
wholly without object or excuse, and to have been a wanton
attack upon the lives of defenceless, and at that time unoffending
individuals. In the same, or even more severe terms, we
must remark upon what was proved as to the firing into the
door-ways of the prisons, more particularly into that of No.
3 prison, at a time when the men were in crowds at the
entrance. From the position of the prison and of the door,
and from the marks of the balls which were pointed out to us,
as well as from the evidence, it was clear this firing must
have proceeded from soldiers a very few feet from the door-way;
and although it was certainly sworn that the prisoners
were at the time of part of the firing at least, continuing to
insult and occasionally to throw stones at the soldiers, and
that they were standing in the way of, and impeding the
turnkey, who was there for the purpose of closing the door,
yet still there was nothing stated which could in our view at
all justify such excessively harsh and severe treatment of
helpless and unarmed prisoners, when all idea of escape was
at an end. Under these impressions we used every endeavor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
to ascertain if there was the least prospect of identifying any
of the soldiers who had been guilty of the particular outrages
here alluded to, or of tracing any particular death at that
time to the firing of any particular individual, but without success;
and all hopes of bringing the offenders to punishment
should seem to be at an end. In conclusion, we, the undersigned,
have only to add, that whilst we lament, as we do
most deeply, the unfortunate transaction which has been the
subject of this inquiry, we find ourselves totally unable to
suggest any steps to be taken as to those parts of it which seem
to call for redress and punishment.</p>

<span class="smcap">London</span>, 18th April, 1815.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>At the request of Lord Castlereagh, we have had
interviews with him and Mr. Goulburn on the subject of the
transportation of the American prisoners now in this country,
to the United States, and of the late unfortunate event at the
depot at Dartmoor.</p>

<p>On the first subject we agreed to advise your acceptance of
the proposition of Lord Castlereagh to transport the prisoners
at the joint expense of the two countries, reserving the construction
of the articles of the treaty, which provides for the
mutual restoration of prisoners, for future adjustment. It
was stated by us, and was so understood, that the joint
expense, thus to be incurred, is to comprehend as well the
requisite tonnage as the subsistence of the prisoners; and
moreover that measures of precaution should be adopted relative
to the health and comfort of the prisoners similar to those
which had taken place in America.</p>

<p>The details of this arrangement, if you concur with us as
to the expediency of making it, are left with you to settle
with the proper British authority.</p>

<p>On the other subject, as a statement of the transaction has
been received from the American prisoners, differing very
materially in fact from that which had resulted from an
inquiry instituted by the port admiral, it has been thought
advisable that some means should be devised of procuring
information as to the real state of the case, in order, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
one hand, to show that there had not been any wanton or improper
sacrifice of the lives of American citizens, or, on the
other, to enable the British government to punish their civil
and military officers, if it should appear that they have
resorted to measures of extreme severity without necessity, or
with too much precipitation.</p>

<p>Lord Castlereagh proposed that the inquiry should be a
joint one, conducted by a commissioner selected by each
government. And we have thought such an inquiry most
likely to produce an impartial and satisfactory result.</p>

<p>We presume that you will have too much occupation on
the first subject and the other incidental duties of your office,
to attend to this inquiry in person. On that supposition, we
have stated to the British government that we should recommend
to you the selection of Charles King, Esq. as a fit
person to conduct it on behalf of the American government.
If Mr. King will undertake the business, he will forthwith
proceed to Dartmoor, and in conjunction with the British
commissioner, who may be appointed on the occasion, will
examine the persons concerned, and such other evidence as
may be thought necessary, and make a joint report upon the
facts of the case to John Q. Adams, Esq. Minister Plenipotentiary
of the United States at this court, and to the British
government.</p>

<p>The mode of executing this service must be left to the discretion
of Mr. King and his colleague. If they can agree
upon a narrative of the facts after having heard the evidence,
it will be better than reporting the whole mass of testimony
in detail, which they may perhaps find it necessary to do, if
they cannot come to such an agreement.</p>

<span class="smcap">Plymouth</span>, 26th April, 1815.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br>
</p>

<p>In pursuance of instructions received from Messrs.
Clay and Gallatin, I have now the honor to transmit to you
the report prepared by Mr. Larpent and myself on behalf of
our respective governments, in relation to the unfortunate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
transactions at Dartmoor Prison of War, on the 6th of the
present month. Considering it of much importance that the
report, whatever it might be, should go forth under our joint
signatures, I have forborne to press some of the points which
it involves, as far as otherwise I might have done, and it
therefore may not be improper in this letter to enter into
some little explanation of such parts of the report. Although
it does appear that a part of the prisoners were on that evening
in such a state, and under such circumstances, as to have justified,
in the view which the commander of the depot could
not but take of it, the intervention of the military force, and
even in a strict sense, the first use of fire-arms, yet I cannot
but express it as my settled opinion, that by conduct a little
more temporizing, this dreadful alternative of firing upon
unarmed prisoners might have been avoided. Yet as this
opinion has been the result of subsequent examination, and
after having acquired a knowledge of the comparatively
harmless state of the prisoners, it may be but fair to consider,
whether in such a moment of confusion and alarm, as that
appears to have been, the officer commanding could have
fairly estimated his danger, or have measured out with precision
the extent and nature of the force necessary to guard
against it.</p>

<p>But when the firing became general, as it afterwards appears
to have done, and caught with electric rapidity from the
square to the platforms, there is no plea or shadow of excuse
for it, except in the personal exasperation of the soldiery, nor
for the more deliberate, and therefore more unjustifiable, firing
which took place into three of the prisons, No. 1, 3 and 4, but
more particularly into No. 3, after the prisoners had retired
into them, and there was no longer any pretence of apprehensions
as to their escape. Upon this ground, as you, sir, will
perceive by the report, Mr. Larpent and myself had no difference
of opinion, and I am fully persuaded that my own regret
was not greater than his, at perceiving how hopeless would
be the attempt to trace to any individuals of the military these
outrageous proceedings.</p>

<p>As to whether the order to fire came from Captain Shortland,
I yet confess myself unable to form any satisfactory
opinion, though perhaps the bias of my mind is, that he did
give such an order. But his anxiety and exertions to stop it
after it had continued for some little time, are fully proved,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
and his general conduct, previous to this occurrence, as far as
we could with propriety enter into such details, appears to
have been characterized with great fairness, and even kindness,
in the light in which he stood towards the prisoners.</p>

<p>On the subject of any complaints against their own government
existing among the prisoners, it was invariably answered
to several distinct questions put by me on that head, that none
whatsoever existed or had been expressed by them, although
they confessed themselves to entertain some animosity against
Mr. Beasley, to whom they attributed their detention in this
country; with what justice you, sir, will be better able to
judge. They made no complaint whatsoever, as to their provisions
and general mode of living and treatment in the prison.</p>

<p>I have transmitted to Mr. Beasley a list of the killed and
wounded on this melancholy occasion, with a request that he
would forward it to the United States for the information of
their friends at home, and I am pleased to have it in my power
to say, that the wounded are for the most part doing well.</p>

<p>I have also enclosed to Mr. Beasley the notes taken by me
of the evidence adduced before us, with a request that he
would have them fairly copied, as also a copy of the depositions
taken before the coroner, and desired him to submit
them to you when in order.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude, sir, without expressing my high sense
of the impartiality and manly firmness with which this inquiry
has been conducted on the part of Mr. Larpent, nor
without mentioning that every facility was afforded to us in
its prosecution, as well by the military officers commanding
here and at the prison, as by the magistrates in the vicinity.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, with much respect, your most obedient
humble servant,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:
</p>

<p>In my letter of the 19th instant, I informed you of the
measures which had been adopted here in consequence of the
late unfortunate event at Dartmoor prison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>I have now the honor to transmit the copy of a letter addressed
to me by Mr. Clay and Mr. Gallatin, relative to that
occurrence, and to the transportation of the American prisoners
in this country to the United States.</p>

<p>In the absence of Mr. Adams, it becomes my duty to communicate,
for the information of our government, the result of
the investigation at Dartmoor. I enclose a copy of the joint
report of the commissioners appointed for that purpose, also of
a letter from Mr. King to Mr. Adams, and of a list of the
killed and wounded on that melancholy occasion.</p>

<p>I shall leave to Mr. Adams any further steps which he may
deem it proper to take in this business. I cannot, however,
forbear to notice the erroneous impression of the prisoners,
that their detention so long has been owing to me. You are
aware, sir, of my constant exertions during the war to effect
their liberation. I immediately, on the signing of the treaty
of peace at Ghent, renewed my instances on that subject;
proposing, as a condition, that all prisoners who might be delivered
over to me by the British government, should be considered
as prisoners of war, and not at liberty to serve until
regularly exchanged, in the event of the treaty not being ratified
by the President. This proposition was declined, and
in a peremptory manner.</p>

<p>On the receipt of the intelligence of the ratification from
America, I lost not a moment in requesting the release of the
prisoners, according to the terms of the treaty; and the number
of vessels which I had hired, as mentioned in my letter of
the 13th, and which are now on their voyage to the United
States, will show that the necessary steps were taken to provide
for their immediate transportation to their country. The
prisoners also were informed of these measures, and of the
exertions which had been made from the commencement, to
return them to their homes with the least possible delay.
Therefore, whatever may have been their uneasiness, under
confinement, and whatever hostile feelings they may have
had towards me, as noticed in the report, and in Mr. King’s
letter, I must say, with confidence, that I could not prevent
the one, nor have I deserved the other.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient humble
servant,</p>

Magrath, and likewise that the subjects of Great Britain may

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Honored and respected Sir</i>:</span>
</p>

<p>From the general philanthrophy of your character, and
liberality of sentiment, no apology is deemed requisite for introducing
to your particular notice, and that of the nation at
large, Dr. George Magrath, principal of the medical department
for the American prisoners of war in England. It is
impossible for us to speak of this gentleman in terms that will
do justice to his superior professional science, brilliant talents,
the exemplary virtues of his heart, the urbanity and easy accessibility
of his manners, his unremitting assiduities and
unwearied exertions, in combatting a succession of diseases of
the most exasperated and malignant character, which prevailed
among the prisoners. At the first forming of the depot, <i>pneumonia</i>,
in its worst form, generally prevailed, which degenerated
into a still more dangerous species of pulmonic complaint,
nearly <i>peripneumonia notha</i>, which was rapidly succeeded
by a putrid kind of measles, and that destructive malady
followed by a malignant small-pox, which spread rapidly;
dismay and apprehension were painted on every countenance.</p>

<p>Dr. Magrath’s time and attention were fully occupied in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
the hospital, and in vaccinating the prisoners. From his unprecedented
exertions in an inclement season of the year, in
a most inhospitable clime, his health became seriously impaired;
but totally regardless of himself, he persevered in his
unparalleled exertions, and from his superior knowledge in
the healing art, was the means, under divine Providence, of
rescuing many citizens of the United States from the fast approximating
embraces of death. This malignant species of
small-pox, unknown to the generality of professional gentlemen,
appeared in other places, and a far greater number fell
victims, in proportion to the cases at the place. We therefore
trust, that some distinguished mark of the nation’s gratitude
will be conferred on Dr. Magrath; for this truly great man’s
exertions in the cause of suffering humanity, have been rarely
equalled, but never excelled.</p>

<p>We have the honor to remain, with sentiments of respect
and attachment, your excellency’s obedient humble servants,</p>

<i>Officers and brave Americans collectively</i>:<br>
</p>

<p>Permit me to request you will accept the warmest and
most sincere thanks of my heart, for the flattering testimonials
of your approbation of my conduct, with which you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
have honored me, and allow me to assure you, that nothing
can be more exquisitely gratifying to my very best feeling,
than the language in which you have been pleased to convey
this mark of your esteem. I feel convinced that you will
indulgently excuse me, if I find it impossible to command
words sufficiently emphatic, adequately to express the sentiments
of gratitude, with which I am penetrated, for this unexpected
proof of your regard; I must therefore allow my
heart, rather than my pen, to thank you. But it would not
be doing justice to my feelings were I to abstain from assuring
you, that I have endeavored to perform my duty towards
you, with that self-devotedness which looks only for its reward
in its own consciousness of right, and its own secret
sense of virtue; and whatever difficulties I have had to encounter
in the discharge of my important trust, by struggling
with a succession of the most violent and exasperated epidemic
diseases, perhaps ever recorded in medical history, during the
whole of my service among you, the distinguished proof of
your confidence, and approbation of my professional labors,
with which you this day have been pleased to honor me,
amply compensates me, and must rank amongst the proudest
and happiest events of my life. It now only remains for me,
in this plain, but unfeigned language, again to beg you will
receive my most sincere thanks; and to assure you, collectively,
that a due and lively sense of the high honor which
you have conferred upon me, shall, to the last moments of my
existence, remain ingrafted in my breast. And here allow
me most sincerely to congratulate you on the happy event
which terminates your captivity, and which is soon to restore
you to the bosoms of your families and friends; and that you
may all enjoy peace and happiness, is the sincere wish of
your most grateful and much obliged humble servant,</p>

<p>Impressed with the sense of duty which we owe to our
country and to ourselves, we respectively solicit permission to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
introduce to your Excellency George Magrath, Esq., M.D.,
principal of the medical department at this depot. Language
is incompetent to delineate the worth and character of this
gentleman, pre-eminent in medical science, enriched by every
virtue and accomplishment that can dignify and adorn human
nature, and form the gentleman and philanthrophist.</p>

<p>His professional skill has been peculiarly conspicuous in
his successfully combatting a succession of diseases, of the
most exasperated and malignant character, which prevailed
among the prisoners.</p>

<p>Dr. Magrath’s health, from his indefatigable exertions,
became seriously impaired, but he persevered in the performance
of his arduous duties and unremitting efforts to arrest
the alarming and rapid advances of the prevailing diseases;
and he was the agent under divine Providence of rescuing
many citizens of the United States from a premature grave,
and as it were, renewing their existence, but more particularly
on the late unhappy occurrence.</p>

<p>Language is too impotent to describe Dr. Magrath’s unexampled
endeavors to prevent the effusion of blood; regardless
of the many dangers by which he was environed, he persevered,
amidst the heavy and incessant fire of musketry, in
his humane endeavors to prevent the fatal catastrophe.</p>

<p>His treatment of the unfortunate wounded Americans is
superior to all praise, and was such as to entitle Dr. Magrath
to the esteem and gratitude of the citizens of the United
States.</p>

<p>We therefore respectfully and ardently solicit that your
Excellency would be pleased to honor Dr. Magrath with
your particular notice and esteem, and to convey these our
sentiments to the government of the United States; for we
would wish to give all possible publicity to our high sense of
Dr. Magrath, and to evince to our country and the world how
gratefully we appreciate the essential services we have received
from that gentleman.</p>

<p>We avail ourselves of this opportunity to offer to your
Excellency our congratulations on the happy termination of
your important duties at Ghent, by the conclusion of a peace
so highly honorable to our beloved country, and to yourself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hanging-indent1">Copy of a letter from Lieut. <span class="smcap">N. D. Nicholson</span>, of the late
United States brig <i>Syren</i>, to Capt. <span class="smcap">Samuel Evans</span>, commanding
naval officer at New-York.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="smcap">New-York</span>, August 24, 1815.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p>Conceiving it my duty to make known the treatment exhibited
by the British officers and men, to those who are so
unfortunate as to fall into their power, I am induced to acquaint
you with the following circumstances:</p>

<p>After the surrender of the <i>Syren</i> to the <i>Medway</i>, the officers
and crew of the former were removed to the latter; the crew
not being allowed the privilege of taking their clothing, &amp;c.,
with them,—so that the prize-crew had a fair opportunity of
plundering such articles as they thought proper; which opportunity
they took care to profit by, as many of our men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
were pillaged of all they possessed, excepting what they had
on at the time; and the officers in like manner were plundered
on board the <i>Medway</i>. The midshipmen, some of them,
were completely stripped; others lost their watches, &amp;c. For
my own part, I came off with the loss of about half my clothing,
and thought myself well off when compared with the losses
of my shipmates.</p>

<p>The morning after our capture, we were mustered on the
quarter-deck, to undergo a search; the men were then stripped
to the skin, and their clothing not returned; so that many
of them were left without any thing more then a shirt and
trowsers. The next day, Mr. Barton (the first lieutenant of
the <i>Medway</i>) distributed the clothing he had taken from our
men, to his quarter-masters and quarter-gunners, in my presence.</p>

<p>After being on board the <i>Medway</i> five weeks, we were
landed at Simon-Town, twenty-five miles to the eastward of
the Cape of Good Hope; myself and brother officers paroled,
and the men marched to Cape-Town under an escort of dragoons;
being obliged to ford a lake on the march, where the
boys were compelled to go over on the backs of the tall men;
this march of twenty-five miles was performed in one day,
and without shoes or food; the latter article they were kept
without four and twenty hours; their shoes were stolen by
the crew of the <i>Medway</i> while they were asleep. After remaining
in this situation nearly eight months, without bed or
bedding, (they were not even furnished with straw, and their
hammocks were taken on a plea of their being public property,)
we were all embarked in different men-of-war and Indiamen
for England; myself, and about sixty officers and men,
in the Cumberland, seventy-four, Captain Baker, were all put
on the lower gun-deck without distinction, among their own
crew, and fed on prisoners’ allowance; and on my remonstrating
with the captain for receiving such treatment, he ordered
me off the quarter-deck, with a threat, at the same time, to
put me in irons.</p>

<p>We remained in this situation eighteen days, after which
Lieut. German, Gordon, and myself, were removed to the
Grampus, thirty, at St. Helena, admitted to the ward-room
mess, and treated with civility.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
